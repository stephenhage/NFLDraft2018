Jets,Ade Aruna,DE/OLB,Tulane,"There's that great article that came out somewhere this week, maybe ESPN, I can't remember, but it was an interview with a scout where he said (paraphrasing) 'what we're looking for is someone who can grow, someone who's not the finished product'. Oh, I found it, it was ESPN. 'I'm looking for late bloomers.' Basically, players have a ten year NFL window where they're good, if they're good. He wants guys who haven't started theirs yet for whatever reason. Either they're young, or they're new to the game or whatever. Well Ade Aruna is just the kind of guy he's talking about, and he's also the kind of guy who goes higher than we think he will. He played his first down of football as a senior in high school, so he's got all the rawness you'd expect him to have. Nothing surprising about that. But man, what a specimen. We all saw it at the combine 6'6, 262, turned in a 4.6 forty and led all defensive linemen with a 38.5 inch vert. Good wingspan huge hands. He's not the bendiest guy in the world but he's not stiff either, and he's built like a brick shithouse. And he's just getting started. Give him two or three years in an NFL strength and condition program and no one will be able to keep him from setting the edge. He's a project, for sure, but he's the kind of project NFL teams are always taking chances on. Sometimes they work out (Michael Strahan, Terrell Owens, Jamie Collins, Terron Armstead, Larry Allen), sometimes they don't (literally hundreds of dudes), but NFL teams are gonna keep taking them.",107,New York,4,4.7,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Chiefs,Alex Cappa,OT/OG,Humboldt State,"We all fell in love with Cappa's vicious tape when they showed it over and over again at both the Senior Bowl and the combine, but I think we fall into a trap of overrating nasty players (Teller, Ragnow, Harrison Phillips, etc...), especially when they play along the lines. It's easy to love those guys, granted, and it's a plus trait on any prospect, but unless they bring more translatable skills to the table (a la Quenton Nelson), a mean streak isn't gonna be enough to sustain a successful career. I remember reading plenty about Ereck Flowers's mean streak back in 2015 (it's true, google it), and look where that's got him. We can't write off Jonathan Bullard yet but he's struggled so far and he too was lauded for his nastiness. Billy Turner, Ra'Shede Hageman, Chance Warmack. Eric Fisher. It's a nice characteristic for a player to have, but it's more of a bonus. Another check in the 'pros' column. But it shouldn't outweigh their weaknesses; sheer nastiness can't overcome a hefty 'cons' column. So, why am I bringing this up now, when I have the Chiefs drafting a nasty player ahead of his draft grade? I can't remember, honestly. I had an idea when I started then I trudged along and this is what came out. Oh wait, I remember, I was gonna say something about how Cappa's viewed as a nasty, effort guy, but I think he's more like Nelson with some real, translatable skills. That was my point. For one, I don't think he's being given enough credit for his athleticism. On tape, I see a guy who ought to be able to hold up at tackle, and though he struggled some early in the week, I thought eventually the Senior Bowl bore that out. He'll need to improve his footwork no surprise coming from a D2 school but once he does I think it will complement his quickness. What I'm getting at here is I think he can be a left tackle (and maybe finally oust nasty Fisher... and here I'm using 'nasty' in a different way). Regardless, I think Cappa will appeal to the Chiefs first for his versatility. He's got the athleticism to play either tackle spot and the strength (and demeanor) to play guard. In two or three years I think he'll be starting somewhere along the Chiefs line, and that makes him worth a fourth round pick.",122,Kansas City,4,4.22,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Raiders,Anthony Averett,CB,Alabama,"We've all made the connection between the Raiders new DB coach (Derrick Ansley) and Minkah Fitzpatrick in the first. Ansley coached Minkah last year as the DB coach at Alabama, and the way Saban spews love for Minkah, you have to think his position coach feels the same way. That match didn't work out in the first as the Raiders opted to trade down, but what about now, with a different Alabama DB? Averett's a great athlete and has all the technique that comes from starting at the position for two years at Alabama. If you want a CB who's gonna cover a guy, Averett's gonna have some appeal. He's a hard guy for WRs to shake. And he's got great reaction time to everything happening around him. He's not a playmaker which is why he won't go earlier. He'll be stuck on a guy's hip but he won't turn and find the ball. He actually reminds me quite a bit of Chris Houston. They're roughly the same height (5'11 and 6'0), they both ran in the 4.3s, and they both have similar issues with the ball in the air. That comp is gonna make Falcons fans cringe he really struggled in Atlanta with that specific aspect of his game but most of my fellow Lions fans remember him fondly. He was our number one guy for a few years and improved dramatically at playing the ball. He still got beat from time to time, but he was nowhere near as rough for us as he'd been in Atlanta and was absolutely a legitimate #1 CB. I don't know if Averett will follow a similar trajectory, I only know his issues are in fact fixable, despite some people saying they aren't. And with his cover skills, if he fixes his ball skills, he would wind up as the best CB in the class.",75,Oakland,3,3.11,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Bills,Anthony Miller,WR,Memphis,"You should all be prepared for a run on receiver, there's still great value and the value at other positions is beginning to thin. That said, the individual choices are gonna come down to preference, and that's a little bit more of a difficult animal to get a handle on. I like Miller here, for instance, as I think he's a great fit in Buffalo. Benjamin's the tall outside catch radius guy, Zay Zay's the all rounder handsy tough guy, and Miller's the dynamo who knifes through the field between them. Dynamo's a good way to describe him too, he reminds me of Antonio Brown the way he's always going full speed into and out of his breaks and after he catches the ball, he's a terror to opposing defenses and he's gonna in turn open things up for Benjamin and Jones. Everything's related, symbiosis achieved, life's made easier for McCarron and Rudolph. I toyed with the idea of mocking Washington here to give Rudolph his former running mate, but I thought he was a little bit superfluous with Jones. Not that they're styles are exactly the same (Washington's play speed is greater), but they're both outside guys, and so is Benjamin. He didn't make as much sense as Miller.",65,Buffalo,3,3.1,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Sometimes it works out (from everything I've heard, Tyreek Hill has been a model citizen in KC), sometimes it doesn't (Marcus Peters though he certainly produced while he was there). They might be more hesitant to go this route now, given the somewhat tumultuous season they just went though with Peters, but something tells me Reid's not gonna change how he does things. He's comfortable with who he is, and he's comfortable giving second chances. He's always been that way. And this is great value for Callaway if he keeps his head on straight, the guy is just so good. I could watch his tape for days. And if he doesn't work out, it's a lost fourth rounder, just like 75% of them league wide. He's worth the risk at this point.

Texans,Armani Watts,S,Texas A&M,"At this point of the draft it's about talent over need. I wouldn't advocate a strict BPA approach, but it's absolutely where the grades start to separate and teams begin drafting guys who might not fill their biggest holes, but who sit atop their boards. Despite signing the Honey Badger during the offseason the Texans could still use some help at safety. Andre Hal has been far better that they could have ever hoped, but he's limited as a player, and he's not the sort of guy who's gonna stop the Texans from taking a safety if one sits atop their board (and it's telling, I think, that they keep bringing 2 4th round safeties in for visits). Armani Watts is a guy they've brought in, and I imagine they've seen plenty of him as he plays his collegiate ball up the road in College Station. Houston has done a good job in the offseason of stopping the bleeding in their secondary (especially with the addition of Mathieu) but adding Watts to it does more than stop the bleeding, it makes it a strength. Plus I think he and Mathieu complement each other well, Watts is a rangy athlete who's one of the better cover safeties in the draft, and he's a good playmaker too. Where he struggles is in run support where he can be hit or miss, and he's a little bit too much of a risk taker. Mathieu will cover for a lot of those issues. I know the Texans have needs on the edge and along the interior of the line, but the value doesn't match up here, or they can be addressed later. You're not finding a guy who fits like a glove the way Watts does if you wait any longer than this.",84,Houston,3,3.20,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Vikings,Austin Corbett,OG,Nevada,"The Vikings need offensive line help, here's offensive line help. There's not much separating Corbett, Ragnow, and Braden Smith (not to mention some of the tackles) and I expect they'll fall in different orders on different teams' boards, but I like Corbett's upside best due to his smarts, the calm with which he plays, the way he rises to the occasion (I thought he was the best offensive lineman at the Senior Bowl), his leadership, and all the shit he's had to overcome to make it to this point. Five years ago you would never have expected him to be here, and I like the guys who overcome the odds. I like that kind of drive. I also like the way he models his game after fellow Nevada alum Joel Bitonio, who I think is one of the best guards in the league. Like, he hovered around him as a freshman and studied him, the way he prepared, his calmness, the way he interacted with his teammates. It almost sounds a little bit stalker y, to be honest, but I'm sure big bro Joel was cool with it. That's a good role model to have, considering how good he turned out as a pro.

Jaguars,Billy Price,OG/C,Ohio State,"In the end, did Price's combine injury really hurt him that much in the draft? I don't know, maybe some team stumps for him in the back third of the first, but that team might well have been Jacksonville (personally, I can't see him coming off the board before Daniels, injured or not, but that's just IMO, of course), and interior linemen tend to drop in the draft (see Lamp last year), so this might have been where he went anyway. Sending Price to Jacksonville is pretty much the chalk thing to do, I doubt I need to explain it too much, but here's a summary despite signing Norwell, the Jags need more offensive line help. Linder and AJ Cann could be upgraded, too often Fournette took a handoff last year and slammed into the back of his own guys cause there was nowhere else to go. Price goes a long way towards remedying that, I’m pretty sure they would have considered him with their first round pick, so adding a couple of extra picks?

Falcons,BJ Hill,DT,NCST,"I keep seeing like, 4th & 5th round grades on HIll, and I'm like, what? Did you see the way he dominated all those stud linemen at the Senior Bowl? Will Hernandez? Step aside. Tyrell Crosby? Out of my way. Wyatt Teller? Please. I have to admit I was like, damn, who is that guy? So I poured over his tape and I came to the conclusion he was vastly underrated (I had him going even higher than this in my first mock), would be a perfect fit as a big, penetrating tackle in a 4 3, and hoping like hell he didn't end up on the Vikings. So thanks Falcons, for ensuring he didn't end up on the Vikings. I guarantee Hill's going higher than he's projected to go, one of those guys who all the experts call a surprise when his name gets read, but who anyone paying attention will be expecting. Guys with his skill set just don't last very long in the draft. I think he has a chance to be better than some of the guys who went in the first. And while on the surface he might not look like the freaky Sparq athletes the Falcons tend to like, if you dig a little deeper into the numbers, you'll find he has the fifth highest rating of the 26 guys who are listed at 310+. Comparing him to the 290 pound guys is an injustice, those guys play different roles. And the Falcons brass has spent a lot of the pre draft process meeting with him, that's gotta be a good sign.",58,Atlanta,2,2.26,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Browns,Bradley Chubb,DE,North Carolina State,"I don't think it's gonna be easy for the Browns to trade down from four, that's how much they like Chubb. In fact I think they like him so much, they'll make a quick move back up. Did they immediately have seller's remorse after trading with the Bucs, or was this their plan all along? I can't say. But what they get out of essentially moving down one spot is the 38th pick in the second round instead of the 64th. All the rest of their picks are the same (well, now they've got the 113th pick in the fourth round instead of the 114th, so basically the same). I'd call that a win. And they got the guy they wanted at four anyway. I think they really, really, really like Chubb. I've thought it for over a month now, before all the silly season stuff really started to heat up, and I'm still thinking it now. So they hop back up from seven and over the Colts to grab him. Like everyone else, I imagine the Broncos were targeting Barkley, but there's lots of good backs in this draft, I don't think they'll do anything rash. And for those of you thinking the Broncos will target Rosen here, see above. I think Rosen's gonna be a hard guy to pull the trigger on. I think if Mayfield or Darnold or maybe even Allen were here, Elway might jump. But I can't see it for Rosen. We all know about his physical gifts and I'm in agreement, I think he's the most gifted QB overall of all these guys. But we also know there's more to playing QB in the league than talent, and to me, that's where Rosen doesn't measure up (again, see Jets pick above for my explanation). I don't think he'll be scared off by Rosen's intelligence or curiosity, I think that stuff's way overblown. But the teammates don't love him thing? That's real. That's... well, like I said, Rosen might be a dick. An immobile dick, with injury concerns. And then there's that business of football being his A#1 pursuit right now, but who knows what the future holds. Come again? Is this gonna be another Jake Plummer situation where he falls in love with Handball, or in Rosen's case, space travel or some shit? That's concerning, and I don't think Elway will take him. I think Rosen will make him nervous this high. I also don't think the Broncos will want to drop below ten, which rules out the Dolphins, Bills and Cardinals as trade partner, unless they get blown away. The trade with Cleveland isn't blown away, but it's a good enough haul, to add a second round pick for dropping two spots.

Panthers,Brian O’Neill,OT,Pittsburgh,"Yes, the Panthers have more of a need at WR, RB, S, probably the interior of the line, you get the idea. Everyone's full of needs right now. But I keep saying it, in the third round and especially the fourth round, that's when the picks start to take on a BPA feel. That's when you got more of your WTFs, and your WhoTFs, and your 'I've heard of that guy, who says I haven't?' Cause you can't really count on a third or fourth rounder to step in and play right away, can you? So how is it filling a need? I mean, you hope they can handle it, but more often than not they can't, and that doesn't make them bad picks. These are ten year investments, if you do it right. (And there are just so many WRs left and so few OTs).  On that note, Matt Kalil still sucks, right? I haven't watched him as much since he left Minny, but I remember him sucking pretty hard, and I haven't really heard anything coming out of Charlotte to the contrary. I know you're tied to him for awhile but he's got an out on his contract after next year, maybe start thinking about what's next? I know Moton was a second round 2017 grab, but he's more of a guard/right tackle kinda guy, right? O'Neill pure left side, baby.

Falcons,Calvin Ridley,WR,Alabama,"I expect the Falcons might get a lot of trade action on this pick, but in the end I think there are two or three guys they decide are too good to pass up on. Now, I'm the one always saying WRs go higher than we think, it's like my draft day mantra. Then I did this mock and they didn't, so what gives? Well after careful consideration, I'm thinking this year that might not be true. There are a couple of drafts over the past decade where WRs didn't go higher than we thought they would, and this draft just feels so jumbled at the top (and deep), it's difficult to justify grabbing one early. I'm sure some FO is gonna fall in love with a guy and snag him before we think he will, but I've kinda already had that happening with Sutton (the most likely guy to be grabbed early, I think, given his unique skill set amongst the top rated guys). This pick, even, while lower than we thought Ridley would go overall is higher than we had the Falcons drafting a WR. I'm sure most of their fans are coming into this draft thinking WR is a 2",26,Atlanta,1,1.26,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Ravens,Calvin Ridley,WR,BAMA,"This is probably the most common pick among mocks. I was really tempted to put both Derrius Guice and Leighton Vander Esch here, but instead to add to their receiver depth.

Jaguars,Calvin Ridley,WR,Alabama,"I like the Jags to take Ridley as they need a competent 3rd receiver and honestly a trio of Ridley, Lee and Moncrief has the potential to make Bortles look good, even though they’re all probably WR2 material. TE is a bigger need, but that class is deep and none of them make sense for a first round pick, if Ridley hits the Jags stand be in contention for the super bowl once again",29,Jacksonville,1,1.29,1J33HKGU4RxTQ1OSYppzlUEW3IXyuurLGxGc_TJgtJNU

49ers,Calvin Ridley,Alabama,WR,"Jimmy G is the new sheriff in town and he needs a right hand man. Bring in one of the most exciting playmakers of the draft, Calvin Ridley.

Ravens,Calvin Ridley,WR,BAMA,"I'm sorry Baltimore fans, I'm sure you're tired of seeing this pick. But on the bright side you're getting the best WR in the draft, and you guys have been in dire need for a while (even after the FA signings). Ridley is a super crisp route runner, and is very agressive. He is ranked #1 with Hurts throwing to him, that's gotta say something!",16,Baltimore,1,1.16,1X_snt2_amBdQ05ZrlYp-X3TQeGuKbxyHJjy69euERTA

Ravens,Calvin Ridley,WR,Alabama,"Even after signing Michael Crabtree this offseason, Baltimore still has not found enough playmakers on offense, so they use their first-round pick to get the best receiver in this draft class in Calvin Ridley. Ridley is one of those players who is not particularly amazing at one thing, but is very good at essentially everything, and I think he'll be solid in the pros.

Panthers,Calvin Ridley,WR,Alabama,"Gotta get Cam some protection and some weapons. Fortunately for them Calvin Ridley is still on the board. His age is a major concern for me, but he's still a top 3 WR in this class. Maybe he wont be a 10 year guy, but he'll definitely be good enough for his 5 yr rookie contract, and thats what important. Funchess isn't very good, Curtis Samuel is just a slot guy, and Torrey Smith isn't a #1 WR. They need Ridley here.",24,Carolina,1,1.24,1ZZEIc9E3Erbvdpwyx_UyD-Cko3GIlSDGjv0VgbQoXzY
Ravens,Calvin Ridley,ALA,WR,The Ravens need a QB. Joe Flacco should be given an award for being able to scam the Ravens for that contract. No pick here is going to help that offense until he is out of the door. That said there next biggest need is WR. Even if he had an unspectacular combine and is maybe a little older than people would like the tape doesn't lie. Ridley is going to be a great #2 in this league unlike a lot of 1st WRs lately will make an impact this season.,16,Baltimore,1,1.16,2PACX-1vQaJ75impLnpt-FuRLFee4e7g_nXU8papwdHb3NdC8VZ63y-wKu8_7PnHUIKEYkcVmQM16S3btjX112
Bills,Calvin Ridley,WR,ALA,Calvin Ridley as somehow become underrated throughout the draft process by a surprising amount of people. I can understand concerns after his average combine and the fact that he's 24 but his tape is fantastic.

Colts,Carlton Davis,CB,Auburn,"The Colts are shifting to a zone defense that may or may not have some Tampa 2 elements (Colts fans weren't exactly sure in the forums I visited). On top of that, Ballard's on record as liking tall, long CBs. Davis, at 6'1 and with freakishly long arms, fits his type. To me, Davis is a steal here. I have him rated in my top three at CB, right behind Ward and Alexander. I just think he's a battler. Yes, he'll get a penalty here and there while he's battling, but give me a guy like that any day. He's huge for a corner, his press is great, and I just can't shake the tape against Mike Williams. I thought he gave the future first rounder more trouble than any DB Williams faced. I love the idea of him playing for Indy, I think he'll be perfect in your zone. It wouldn't surprise me at all if he ends up being the best CB in the draft. As it stands the Colts have Quincy Wilson, himself a second rounder last year who certainly flashed, and Pierre Desir, who's bounced around the league for awhile. They absolutely have to add another body into the mix.",36,Indianapolis,2,2.4,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

49ers,Charvarius Ward,CB,Middle Tennessee State,"The Vikings have no problem dropping down a few spots to add a fourth rounder, and the 49ers have to get above the Seahawks (or at least they'll think they will) to grab the guy they want. It's hard to believe 20+ picks have come off the board since the last CB was drafted, but it goes to show the disparity between the top 6/7 guys and everyone else. I suspect it's also surprising to see that the next guy off the board is Ward, but I don't think it will be come draft day. Remember a couple of years back, when another DB from Middle Tennessee came off the board three picks from now, at the top of the third round? When the Titans drafted Kevin Byard we were all like, what? Well, a lot of us were anyway. And now he's coming off a season where he led the league in picks. I can see a similar draft trajectory for Ward, who's one of the best CBs who fit the ""Seattle model"" for the position. That is, he's got the long arms and the tall frame that teams who run Seattle's D want. On top of that he ran a 4.45 at his pro day and from what little tape I could find, he plays as fast as he times. I think he's the classic case of a guy some team's gonna fall in love with, then hear that a lot of other teams have sneakily fallen in love with him too (in Ward's case, that would be Atlanta, Seattle and the Chargers), and once the Falcons and Chargers pass on him, Lynch is gonna decide to jump the Seahawks to make sure they get him.",62,San Francisco,2,2.30,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Ravens,Christian Kirk,WR,Texas A&M,"It's Ozzie's last draft, I say he's going for it, leave on a high note. I also think Kirk would have at least been in the discussion at nineteen, so when he drops and they have a chance to go up and get him, they do it. They've already added a third rounder to their haul thanks to their first round trade with Dallas, so they offer one of them to the Bears to come up. I know there's a lot of depth at WR and there would have been a lot of guys available at pick 52 (not to mention a bunch of TEs), but Kirk's a different kind of talent, and he can plug in as the Ravens returner right away. I suspect he's number one on a lot of boards at this point, and it's only the depth of the draft at his position and some needs elsewhere that sees him dropping. So I say the Ravens pounce, and totally remake their WR corps in a matter of two rounds. I imagine Chicago will consider picking him themselves before deciding that given all the WR depth they could use the extra pick (plus, it's becoming a thing that Pace trades down in the second round).",39,Baltimore,2,2.7,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Cowboys,Chukwuma Okorafor,OT,WMU,"After this round, Denver has two picks in the fifth then they're done, so dropping down ten spots to add another fifth will appeal to them, especially since they’ve got so many other picks around here. For Dallas, they're shocked to see this big unit still on the board and decide to pounce. Okorafor's raw, but he's gigantic and athletic and those guys get drafted and those guys get played. I'm sure the plan is to plug Fleming in at RT and shift Collins back to guard (it has to be), so Chuks will be insurance in case Fleming doesn't work out at RT, insurance against another injury to Tyron Smith, or worst case a swing tackle (he has experience on both the right and left sides). If he can get some of his technique and consistency issues sorted out, he has a chance to man the right side in Dallas for a long, long time. And while they still need to add a linebacker or two, I'd bet almost any amount of money Jerry's got his eyes on Josey Jewell, who can maybe be had in the fifth or sixth. I'd be shocked if Dallas came out of the draft without him. Well, not shocked. Surprised, let's say that. No need for hyperbole.",106,Dallas,4,4.6,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Gettleman actually said as much publicly, and they're in a good spot to do it, even if they stay put. But Williams's versatility makes him a special case, and there's a lot of teams around here looking at offensive linemen, especially ones with the potential to play both tackle and guard (including the hated Eagles, at the next pick). If we look at Williams's pre 2017 tape, you'd think you were watching a top 10 pick. Then 2017 happened, and things fell apart a little bit for him. I did like the way he came back after injury, though. That was more like the guy from before, and a good sign that Williams is on his way back to being that guy. Sure, the Giants have a lot of other needs too, especially since they're switching to a new defensive scheme, but they're not gonna fill them all in this draft. It's just not doable. That's why the trade up makes sense for a guy like Williams. Get the best guys, not the most guys. It'll be nice to have his fifth year option too. From the Seahawks perspective, they need better picks, and they often trade down from the late first.

Bengals,DaeSean Hamilton,WR,Penn State,"The fourth round is where we often start to see need taking a back seat to 'guys we love', so in that spirit I've really poured over the visit lists and meetings and just generally tried to get an idea who teams have loved throughout the process, not just who they're said to love lately (which I hesitate to believe, especially if it's come out over the past two weeks). It's pretty clear to me that Cincinnati really likes DaeSean Hamilton. And while at first glance WR doesn't seem like a need for the Bengals, I wouldn't say they've exactly got it covered either. LaFell's 31 and his contract runs out at the end of the year, Tyler Boyd's been mostly nondescript over his first two seasons, save for the TD that sent the Bills to the playoffs, and who knows what they've got with John Ross? It's way too early to give up on him (or Boyd, for that matter), but the Cincy brass has to be concerned with the way his rookie season went. Even AJ Green will turn 30 this offseason, wow, that's hard to believe. But the most telling thing is that if they do like Hamilton, they're gonna have to grab him here. He's not lasting until their next pick. So that's what I have them doing. Hamilton's an easy guy to love. I hesitate to call anyone bust proof, but Hamilton might be as close as it gets. I think he's probably the best route runner in the class (him or Ridley), and there's always room for guys like that in the league. He may never lead the league in yards or catches, and he'll drop a pass now and again, but if you want a guy who consistently gets open, Hamilton's the guy for you.",112,Cincinnati,4,4.12,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Saints,Dallas Goedert,TE,South Dakota State,"I admit it, I really like the idea of Dallas drafting Dallas Goedert. What's messed up is I can kinda see Jerry liking it too. I mean, maybe? Could you really put it past him? It'll be interesting to see how Jerry plays around come draft day, given the draft's in his palace and he's nothing if not a showman. In that spirit I tried to find a way to move the Cowboys up, but I couldn't find a way to get them past New Orleans, so the dream dies (I'm only mentioning it so that when Dallas does do something crazy like trade up for Goedert on draft day, you guys can all be like 'hey, that guy on Reddit called this shit, good on him'. I live for those kind of faraway plaudits that I'll never know even happened). So I know a lot of Saints fans prefer Gesicki, and I admit it seems to be about a 50/50 split atop TE boards. Here's a few reasons I have Goedert higher, and why I think FOs will too. 1) Sure, Gesicki tested off the charts, but can we say Goedert wouldn't have too? Watching tape, I don't see that big of a difference between the two of them athletically. Gesicki's a great athlete for the position, but I didn't see anything that told me he was gonna run a 4.54 either. That was surprising. Maybe Goedert would have surprised too, had he been healthy enough to run. I suppose we'll never know. 2) Goedert has the potential to be a better blocker. This is the big one to me. For all of Gesicki's strengths, blocking is a major red flag. It's not just that he's high cut and not really built for it, it's that he genuinely doesn't seem to care. And he was blocking for one of the best college RBs in decades, you think he would have cared. Goedert's no great shakes as a blocker, but he's far more willing and he's got a frame conducive to holding up. He improved his technique this year too, something you can't say about Gesicki at all. If Goedert can cut down on all of the one handed catch attempts, he can be one of the best TEs in the game. In New Orleans, with Drew Brees, he'll thrive.",42,New Orleans,2,2.10,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Lions,Dalton Schultz,TE,Stanford,"Well I suppose I'll be accused of waiting too long to grab a RB and that's valid, given it's my mock, but remember if I had been making the picks I would have taken Michel in the second. So don't blame me. Blame the vibes Quinn's giving off, or blame his NFL upbringing, or blame the coaching change on the line, or the addition of O Line dudes. All of it adds up to us not drafting a RB in the first two rounds, and now there's not one here to draft. It is what it is, that's how Quinn's gonna roll if the value's not right. He won't be grabbing a RB at any cost. But then on top of that I'm having us grab a TE? Lions fans have a hate hate relationship with the TE position after the Ebron flop and the Pettigrew mini flop so we'll definitely be throwing stuff after this one. I think most of our fans would be fine not drafting one at all, or at least waiting until the fifth before taking a punt. And hey, I'm with you, Lions fans.

Saints,Dante Pettis,WR,Washington,"Aside from TE (which has already been covered by the selection of Goedert), quite a few Saints fans would have you believe WR is their biggest need. I don't necessarily agree with that point of view. We all know Michael Thomas is a stud, they've just signed Cameron Meredith (and if he can recapture his old Bears form, I think he could set the league on fire in New Orleans), Ted Ginn had a great year for them last year and only seems to be getting better with age, Brandon Coleman's still around to go up and snag the high balls, and technically Willie Snead's still on the roster too, though I expect him to be released now that the Bears declined to match Meredith's offer. And you have to consider Goedert part of the pass catching mix now too. To me, that doesn't scream need. Could they add some depth? Sure, absolutely, but it's not a position I'd be pining to fill too early. But, this is Sean Payton we're talking about (and Mickey Loomis too, but that's not as interesting to the rest of us). Since when has need been his main reason for drafting someone? He finds guys he loves and he goes and gets them. And I think he's gonna love Dante Pettis, and the Saints fans are gonna think he's filling a need when he's really going BPA. Pettis can even start to take over the return duties from Ginn to help keep him fresh, he might be the best return man in the draft. Certainly he's the most accomplished.",67,New Orleans,3,3.3,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Bills,Darius Leonard,LB,South Carolina State,"I'm trying to figure out why Leonard isn't going higher in the mocks I've read. Is it his small school background? I mean, competition level is always a concern and any team drafting him will have to get comfortable with it, but that hasn't stopped other small school guys from going high. Leonard was fantastic in the Senior Bowl against the big boys, and he basically single handedly stone walled Tarik Cohen last year (Cohen's worst collegiate game), one of the few NFL caliber players he faced off against. Maybe it's the fact that NFL.com mislabels his weight as being 213 (and that a lot of other sites seem to be taking their cue from nfl.com and mislabeling him too)? Everyone knows that's not right, right? A cursory search will reveal that he weighed in fine at 234. Not only that, but he checked in with 34 3/8 inch arms and a 82 1/8 wingspan.

Eagles,Da'Ron Payne,DT,Alabama,"So Philly's loaded and can go BPA blah blah blah, you know the story, it's not a new one. But here's the main reason they should go BPA it's time to start preparing for life without a QB on a rookie contract. As early as next offseason you're gonna ink Wentz to one of the largest deals in NFL history and you're gonna have to start sloughing dudes left and right. You went for it while you had the QB on a rookie contract the equivalent of NFL gold and it worked, you won your Super Bowl. But pretty soon it won't, and you'll have to operate like most of the NFL teams who have their franchise QB. You're gonna have to make some tough decisions. Just look at what's happening to Seattle, the fallout of inking Russ to his contract. While he was on his rookie contract and playing for peanuts, they were stacked. Now, they aren't. You've already begun to do it, Eagles fans. Vets like Ngata and Bennett on short term deals, those guys won't be back once Wentz is signed. But that's not enough.

He can do what Poe did as a 1-tech, but also possesses the athletic ability to play some 3-tech if Quinn/Manuel want to get creative.

Vikings,Da'Shawn Hand,DT,Alabama,"After addressing their main need along the O line, the Vikings are situated to go BPA as much as they want. Hand is most often thought of as a 3 4 end (unsurprising since that's where he played in college), but at 6'4, 297 can easily shift into the middle of a 4 3. In fact I think he may be better off as a penetrating tackle, which is exactly how the Vikings would use him along their line (he was crushing it there at the Senior Bowl before he got hurt, pretty much the only guy who got the best of Isaiah Wynn). He's a good, quick athlete with good technique and a high footballing IQ (like most Bama guys), but he won't be pushed around in the run game. He gets labeled as a jack of all trades and master of none kind of guy (which explains his drop), but I think that's unfair. Like so many other Alabama guys, he sacrificed himself for the team somewhat, and was never given the chance to show out at his best position. Think of Da'Ron Payne. Before the playoffs he'd been pretty meh as a 0/1",94,Minnesota,3,3.30,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

He might never offer much going towards the passer, but then neither does Linval Joseph, there's a spot for him on the Vikes. This is a sheer value pick, he's a fit in Minny's D and he's a bargain. He might not play much as a rookie behind Joseph and Richardson, but he'll put in some minutes and he'll make Zimmer think twice about hanging onto Joseph any longer, whose cap hit plummets after this season.

Bills,Denzel Ward,CB,OSU,"I know we've heard all the news about how the Bills are trying to trade up, and I think that's probably true. But let me reiterate, here's the vibe I've gotten from the Bills FO so far they have a set of parameters they're willing to work within, and anything outside of that they simply disregard. They won't panic or get ripped off, which is (one of the reasons) why we haven't seen any movement already. They're Belichickian that way, or at least they seem to be to me. So I don't know, call it a hunch, but I just can't see them overpaying to the extent the Dolphins did to trade up for a QB, especially when it was Rosen who fell (I imagine he'll be the least favorite of the Bills FO). I suppose this makes Buffalo the loser of the great QB rush (though I still wouldn't be shocked if they traded for Nick Foles later on), but I certainly expect them to draft a QB at some point. On the plus side, not having to grab one of the QBs means they can sit back and let one of the best players in the draft fall to them. CB's not Buffalo's biggest need, but at this point, he's too good a player to pass on. He might not have the length they'd prefer, but he doesn't have the length anyone prefers, technically, but you overlook that sort of thing with a guy this talented. He and White will give the AFC East nightmares for years to come.",12,Buffalo,1,1.12,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

With the Eddie Jackson/Adrian Amos pairing at safety, Chicago could look to add DB talent in the form of CB Denzel Ward. Ward is an elite athlete who can play man and zone coverage concepts due to his fluidity in movement. He is excellent at playing the balling and countering a size mismatch with his jumping ability.

So I think DB is the choice here, which leaves you to choose between Minkah and Ward. And while I love Minkah and think he can play CB, The 49ers just don't need someone that is more of a Safety.

Bears,Deon Cain,WR,Clemson,"It's not often you find a guy with Cain's upside in the fourth round.

Dropped too many passes (a concentration thing IMO, not a hands thing), he didn't show out when he took over as Clemson's #1, got frustrated a lot and his effort waned. We all thought he was in line to be a first round pick before this season, he has that kind of natural ability. Then the season happened, and here he is. Now for the good stuff, I don't think any of it will be too surprising. You watch the guy play and your first thought is, 'that guy's an NFL receiver.' He looks the part. He's fast, he breezes by coverage when his head's in it, he fights for the ball, he's great once he has it in his hands. He just looks like he belongs out there. There aren't too many guys you can watch where you can just glance up and catch a glimpse of one random play that makes you think to yourself, he's gonna crush the league.

Raiders,Derrius Guice,RB,LSU,"I'm aware this pick is not going to be well liked by Raiders fans, not with James, McGlinchey, Hurst, Roquan, Payne, any number of WRs on the board. But this isn't an exercise in need filling, it's an exercise in attempting to approximate a real draft. And that means there's going to be surprises. And a lot of those surprises come from teams with new coaches, and I expect that's especially true of a new coach with the power of Gruden. So I thought to myself as I was doing this, who most strikes me as a Gruden style player? OK, old guys with experience, I get it. But who's the most Gruden style player in the draft? Because there's no way Gruden's not running this thing. McKenzie's done a pretty good job over the years but he just got usurped. Mark Davis wanted Gruden and handed him the keys to the kingdom, what Gruden says goes, no matter what kinda smile McKenzie puts on his face or what they say to the media. So, is it gonna be a guy like James? Maybe. But safety's not really a need, and the extra pick allows Oakland to really hammer BPA here, and my inclination is that Gruden's going to really love Guice, and Guice is gonna love playing for Oakland, with the guy he's most often compared to in Marshawn Lynch. But I see this pick as a tone",15,Oakland,1,1.15,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Guice is a powerful back out of LSU and possesses an exceptional balance of speed, power, and balance as the top interior rusher in the draft.

Cowboys,Derwin James,S,Florida State,"The Cowboys overpay on the trade value chart to play keepaway from their division rival Redskins. Well, also because James is a great player and a really good fit for Dallas at a position of need. But you can bet your ass Jerry's chuckling to himself after leapfrogging his buddy Dan Dan and snatching the player he (and everyone else) will assume the Redskins were zeroed in on. When I started this, James was one of the guys where I said to myself ""he's gonna go a little higher than everyone thinks"". Then I dug in, and well, he didn't. I considered mocking him to Oakland, but he's not really a fit and the trade down won out. Then I considered sending him to Buffalo, but I never expected a talent like Ward to fall to them, and given a roughly similar grade, CB > S more often than not. Then I thought well surely the Redskins will take him, right? But then they got the offer from the Chargers and decided recouping their lost third rounder sounded pretty good to them. Then the Packers and Raiders (again) went different directions, and here we are. It's not shocking, I suppose. Safeties tend to fall, and James is coming off a pretty crap year, by his standards. But that won't stop Jerry from stumping for him, and I expect it'll be a pretty big hit with the home crowd. So I did this all before Dez got released (and if I may toot my own horn just a little, like I predicted back in February in my mock and caught so much shit over), but I still think the first round plays out this way, even after the fact. James should be waaaaay higher on everyone's boards than any of the WRs, and there's good depth in this draft at WR, so the Cowboys can afford to wait.",16,Dallas,1,1.16,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Saints,DeShon Elliott,S,Texas,"The Saints are in the enviable position of drafting almost solely for depth at this point. Sure, maybe they're linebacker corps could use an upgrade Anzalone's a walking injury waiting to happen, Klein and Davis are both solid in the run game but not so great against the pass but the value's not right at LB here, and the fourth round (really the whole of the third day) is for grabbing value, not reaching to fill needs when no one expects a fourth rounder to contribute much anyway. With Vonn Bell, Marcus Williams and Kurt Coleman the Saints have some depth at safety, but Bell is only average in coverage IMO (and OK against the run) and Coleman turns 30 this summer. It certainly wouldn't hurt them to have a guy like Elliott waiting in the wings, who some people have mocked as high as the second round. And as a bonus, he played plenty of downs at UT lined up as a linebacker, so if Klein and Davis aren't up for the job of coverage, maybe Elliott can flex into the hybrid role from time to time. He's strong enough against the run to hold up. Maybe he'll thrive enough to make the switch permanent.",127,New Orleans,4,4.27,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Browns,Desmond Harrison,OT,West Georgia,"So who are the jewels of day 3? There's usually around 5 10 guys that most of the drafting world had graded as top 3 round picks who fall here (not counting the 3rd 4th guys), and sometimes the team picking first can get a windfall. So let's see... Mark Andrews maybe? Tyquan Lewis? Maybe Chukwuma Okorafor and Kyle Lauletta too. And of course Shaquem the dream the feel good story is still around. I wonder if he's still sitting in the green room? Man I hope not. My hunch is anyone wanting to trade with Cleveland during the Friday Saturday overnight is gonna have to blow them away, most likely with future picks. They've still got plenty of picks coming up, what good does it do them to, for example, drop ten spots and swap with the Rams for two extra sixth round picks? For some teams I think that would work, but for the Browns, I doubt it. And I'm not sure any of the guys left are worth tossing a future third at. I'm sure plenty of NFL might think otherwise, but I can't see it right now. So I've got the Browns staying put and drafting Harrison, throw him into the mix at OT. Or more like, sit him for awhile and teach him up and hope you don't have to throw him into the mix at OT. He's raw as sushi, only ever played games against Jucos and little tiny schools, but man, what a unit. We all saw what he did at the combine, set it on fire then he stoked the flames.

We all know Chark has the potential to be special, like A.J. Green style. 6'4 guys shouldn't be able to run like he runs, and in the Indy offense with him on one side and Hilton wreaking havoc on the other, if Luck's shoulder is healthy, he's gonna have a lot of fun throwing to these guys. All that speed is gonna open up the running game too, and let's be honest Indy fans... I think Ryan Grant's been underappreciated too, but he's not a guy who stops you from upgrading a position. He came into last season as like the fourth option on the Redskins, and it's not like they had Desean Jackson and Pierre Garcon ahead of him anymore.

Browns,DJ Moore,WR,Maryland,"I think we can all assume Landry's gonna be there for a long time, but Josh Gordon's Josh Gordon, and he might do a lot of Josh Gordon things. It seems short sighted to not have a contingency plan. And I don't know what to think of Corey Coleman at this point, I have a hunch the narrative on him right now is worse than his actual performance (a big time drop will do that for you), but it's got to be a consideration as well. A lot of people have Moore atop their boards at WR and while some might argue he's a bit superfluous with Landry already aboard, I disagree. I see Moore as an outside receiver in the Steve Smith mold, and him, Gordon and Landry make for one of the best receiver corps in the league. I have to say as I'm doing this I'm somewhat baffled by all the talent that appears to be on the Browns roster. I could easy see a Jags style leap in their immediate future, I think they might have more sheer talent than any other team in the AFC North. Of course winning takes a lot more than talent, and the Browns do have the issue of Hee",33,Cleveland,2,2.1,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

I mean, you guys have so many needs anyway I'm sure he'll hit them no matter who he drafts). Eli Apple might have been brought back, but can you really trust him, Giants fans? How soon before he and Collins are fist fighting after a tough loss in the locker room? Even if they manage to make it through the season together, who's the NB next to Apple and Jenkins? All I can see on the roster right now are a bunch of FAs and low round picks.

Broncos,Dorance Armstrong,DE,Kansas,"No matter what you think of Shane Ray as the starter opposite Von Miller, Denver could use some depth on the edge. Armstrong's an intriguing guy who might have gone a lot higher than this if he'd been in last year's draft, but falls due to a subpar 2017. But it's starting to look like we should take those 2017 numbers with a grain of salt. He was shifted into a different role on the Kansas defense, tasked with stopping the run before attacking the pass. That's not his strength (though perhaps the experience will benefit him). If you want to get the most out of Armstrong, you put him on the edge to attack. He didn't test as well as some thought he would, but he's plenty athletic on his game tape. Denver's had a lot of luck with Jayhawk alums recently (Talib, Harris), why not go back to the well? We know they've met with him, and as I’ve said, that means something to Denver.",81,Denver,3,3.17,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

I guess technically Bradley Roby's the replacement for Aqib Talib, but have we decided whether he's actually any good or not, Broncos fans? Maybe? Well either way you gotta throw another body into the mix and here's one, Duke Dawson's. He's predominantly a nickel back but he's one of the best, sticky like sticky rice, first team All SEC baby! Those are some bona fides. Great in press, great tackler, smart fella and fundamentally sound like a smart fella tends to be.

Packers,Duke Ejiofor,DE,Wake Forest,"Philly's only got one pick over the past three rounds, so this trade down makes sense for them. This makes for the third round in a row Green Bay has traded up, it's a good strategy with a lot of picks, sit back and strike. It's really too bad Ejiofor couldn't participate in any of the pre draft process. I would have liked to see if he tested as more athletic than he looked on tape, like Sam Hubbard and Marcell Frazier. We all know it happens, sometimes athleticism shows up in sneaky ways, a guy who makes a ton of plays might actually be making them cause he's got the sneaky explosion to drive at a QB or RB at the last moment, even though he might not have looked so explosive getting there. Or sometimes what looks like a lumbering step is actually a long, faster one. We see it all the time with RBs and WRs, they don't look like they're going fast, yet they're blowing by everyone. Maybe Ejiofor's like that too, I wish we knew. Because now we're left to look at the tape, and while I think he's pretty advanced as a collegiate DE with his hand usage and his moves and counters, it's hard to say he looks like anything more than an average athlete. Too bad. He's been one of my favorite guys throughout the process (I even mocked him to my Lions in the second round back in February), but I always questioned his athleticism and hoped I'd get answers. I didn't, and the league won't, so I imagine he'll fall. I don't know if he's athletic enough to play on the edge in Green Bay's defense, but it's not like Nick Perry or Clay Matthews are Sparq monsters (or Vince Bieber, for that matter), Ejiofor seems like he'd be close to those guys as athletes, and he's got a lot of other things to offer in attack. And if it doesn't work out, he can put on a few pounds and shift inside.",130,Green Bay,4,4.30,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Packers,Equanimeous St. Brown,WR,Notre Dame,"The Packers have a ton of picks to play around with, so it's no surprise to see them moving up in each of the past two rounds. Here they move for a guy who'll fit seamlessly into their receiver corps in St. Brown. There are some who think he might wind up the best receiver in the class. I don't know about that, but there's no doubt you can basically throw 2017 out the window. Notre Dame morphed into a poor QB'd running team and St. Brown didn't have much of a chance to show what he could do. Go back to 2016 though, and it makes you think those people who say he could be the best in the class might be right. With Adams on one side and Cobb slicing and dicing through the middle, they could use a tall gazelle to open up the other side (Geronimo Allison doesn't count). And he shouldn't have any problems adapting to the pros. It's not that big of an adjustment going from Wimbush to Rodgers.

49ers,Frank Ragnow,OG/C,Arkansas,"I like Ragnow as a fit in San Francisco cause I think he'll make a better guard than center (and the Niners just signed Richburg to play center). A lot of people disagree with me and that's fine, but I thought the most alarming part of Ragnow's game was his delayed response to stunts and twists. It popped off the screen to me (perhaps cause I look for it) and while he was able to recover for the most part, I immediately thought of the potential crushing my QB might take if I drafted him in the NFL. At guard, that's not such an issue. Richburg can identify those things ahead of time and ready his linemates to take action. I much prefer the idea of Ragnow shifting to center only in a pinch, and given Richburg's concussion history, it's good to have a capable backup around. I also didn't think Ragnow was the greatest athlete at guard, but otherwise I really like him. He's a nasty dawg for one I think that's why he's such a favorite of the drafting community, we always love the dawgs and despite his delayed response to stunts, he never gave up a sack in the SEC. That's impressive. I also think he's one of the best interior linemen in the class at reaching the second level (behind only Daniels), and he's got a knack once he's there for keeping his balance and securing the block. I expect a long career from him, as long as he's used the right way.",74,San Francisco,3,3.10,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

49ers,Fred Warner,LB,BYU,"This is a really hard pick to figure out. We've reached the point of the draft where it's gonna start moving further and further away from what we think of as chalk and more into WTF territory. Or maybe it's not as dramatic as WTF, maybe it's more subdued like 'hmmm, that's interesting' or 'didn't see that coming' or something like that. The point is, strange stuff's about to start happening. Our valuations are gonna start to differ drastically from the NFL's valuations, and it's really hard to tell who they're going to evaluate as better players than we do, cause it's gonna vary on a team by team basis. Honestly, just take a look at the receivers who are left. The narrative probably says Washington or Miller is the next to come off the board, maybe St. Brown. But I expect NFL boards will be all over the place. Some will have Pettis ranked highest remaining, some Deon Cain, some Gallup, some even DaeSean Hamilton or Antonio Callaway. It could literally be almost anyone of like, twenty guys. So it's in that vein of thinking that I'm giving the 49ers Warner here.

He can play inside or outside, he can rush the passer, he can cover backs and tight ends (a work in progress, he's much better right now against the run which just so happens to be a weakness of the Chargers).

Jets,Geron Christian,OT,Louisville,"The roster fix is a long term one for the Jets, so they can afford to draft a guy with whom they'll have to be patient. If it takes Christian a year or two to come good, well that's right with the timeline. He played in one of those janky college schemes but has three years of starting experience. He's got a perfect LT frame and long arms, but he needs time to fill out. He's a great athlete for the position as a former basketball player and he rarely gets beat inside something I imagine the Jets and their rookie QB will really like about him. Still, he's far more of an athlete than a technician, he has problems staying strong at the point of attack and gets walked into the backfield by powerful defenders, and he can often seem a step slow not because of his athleticism, but because he doesn't have confidence in what he sees. He might be a superstar in three years, but the Jets will hope he takes to coaching quicker than that. But I'm not shocking anyone here by mocking the Jets an offensive tackle, everyone knows they need one, they might even need two. To find a guy with this kind of upside in the third is a draft victory.",72,New York,3,3.8,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

The Niner D is crying out for a guy like Landry to plug into their LEO spot, or even maybe at SAM, so it's pretty damn convenient that the value matches up here (the way I see it anyway, and the way I imagine the Niners see it too). Landry's got Von Miller potential if he can reach his ceiling, and there's not a lot of dudes you can say that about. Now I will say, Landry's got some bad tape, especially in 2017, which makes him sort of an odd evaluation. Because it's more of a projection more than an evaluation. You're looking at that 2016 tape when he shredded everyone and you're justifying his subpar 2017 by saying he was injured. Well, maybe. But you better be right.

Dolphins,Hayden Hurst,TE,South Carolina,"He and Ian Thomas are my favorite TEs in the draft, so it says something that Hurst comes off the board almost a full round later. And what it says is he's old. I mean, he's only 24 (25 by the start of the season), so if that's old I'm ancient, so I suppose it makes more sense to say he's draft old. Whatever, you guys know what I'm talking about, I don't know why I'm bothering to explain it. He's also a perfect fit into the Dolphins lineup, which is why I have some concerns over whether Tannenbaum will draft him or not. You know what I'm talking about Dolphins (and Jets) fans. The Dolphins have a lot of directions they could go here, but if you factor in need + value, Hurst is the right guy. And it doesn't hurt to get your new QB a nice security blanket, that's what the best teams do, help out their franchise QBs (which again gives me pause re Tannenbaum). But I thought in 2017 he showed some patience and stayed put and for the most part did a good job of drafting for need + value, and if he continues that, Hurst has got to be the guy. And Hurst feels like a good partner for Rosen, an older guy who’s lived a little, knows about life and stuff. He can keep Rosen’s idealism in check while at the same time engaging him the way most rookies can’t. He’ll be up for the challenge.",73,Miami,3,3.9,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Patriots,Ian Thomas,TE,Indiana,"First of all, I think there's a very high probability the Pats trade Gronk (it may have already happened by the time I get around to posting this). Belichick is renowned for getting rid of guys a year early, not a year late. Hell, he might have already waited too long. But whether they trade him or not I think they'll be drafting a TE this year, and I think they'll be drafting one early. Now, one thing about the Pats over the years, it's usually possible to get an idea what position they'll go, but we almost always get the player wrong. And that's because they value different things than we do as a drafting community. Sometimes it works (Logan Mankins, Jimmy Garoppolo, Jamie Collins), sometimes it doesn't (Ras I Dowling, Chad Jackson, Aaron Dobson), but they stick with the way they do things, and can you blame them? Look at all those trophies. So while most of the drafting community will have both Gesicki and maybe Hurst rated above Thomas, my hunch is the Pats value a TE's blocking ability more than most (see Gronkowski, Rob). Thomas is still raw as both a blocker and a route runner, but man, what a piece of clay to mold. He's humble, he works hard, he's taken to the coaching at Indiana and improved drastically over his time there. He actually reminds me somewhat of David Njoku, though I'd argue he might have a higher upside. He's got the athletic ability and the size to be a multi tool TE, which I think the Pats will value over the one",53,New England,2,2.21,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Browns,Isaiah Oliver,CB,Colorado,"Why would the Browns jump themselves? Well at this point it's not about jumping themselves, it's about all the other teams trying to get back into the first round by jumping them. The late first rounders always have lots of action, everyone wants the fifth year option, but the Browns have a major leg up on the rest via draft capital. They can bob and weave around the board as they see fit. And maybe they like two guys here and they're worried one won't make it to 35? It's an easy enough thing to recoup the fourth rounder they sent Philly's way by trading down again in the second. It makes them willing trade partners. As for why Oliver, well it's an easy enough thing to see the Browns are looking heavily at CB, they've already met with nine of them, including Oliver, and that's only the ones we know about. And though I don't count myself among them, there are certain factions of the scouting community who consider Oliver to be the best CB in the draft. Whether he is or not, it stand to reason he'll be one of a handful of guys other teams are trying to trade up for, so the Browns play it safe and do so themselves.

Vikings,Jaire Alexander,CB,Louisville,"Answer me this, Vikings fans... when has Spielman ever done what you wanted him to do? That's the vibe I got after I did my first mock, and that vibe was only strengthened as I perused your boards in preparation for this one. He frequently makes you guys angry with his picks. So it can't be shocking that in a draft so deep at the interior of the offensive line (and with only one having come off the board so far), that he'd nab one of the draft fallers at a more premium position and choose to address the interior of the line in the 2nd/3rd round (FWIW, I think Williams is an interior guy too, the only OT worth a first rounder has already come off the board). In his whole history with you guys, he's only drafted an offensive lineman twice in the first two rounds. He's drafted that many CBs in the first round alone (and one of them happens to have a contract that expires at the end of the year). Now I know there are probably lots of linemen you love here, but I'm trying to make this as realistic as possible, and I really think if one of the elite CBs or DTs (or McGlinchey) falls here, he'd nab them over an interior lineman, that's just how he operates. Failing that I think he'd trade down. So when not one not two but three potential first round CBs are staring him in the face, I don't think he can resist. The question, then, is does Spielman prefer a guy who can take over for Alexander in the slot this year (as he's looking more and more like a bust) before potentially flexing outside if Waynes leaves (Mike Hughes, for example, or Jaire Alexander), or does he prefer one of the longer CBs that they use on the outside (Oliver), who'll most likely sit for a year. The Vikings don't appear to have a ""type"" of CB they like the way Seattle does (Rhodes, Waynes and Mackensie Alexander have very different measurables), I expect if you can cover and hit and listen to coaching, you'll be an option for Zimmer. For me the BPA among those three guys is Jaire Alexander (I have him as 1b to Ward's 1a, in fact he's my CB draft crush), and I highly doubt I'm alone. I see him going higher than Hughes and Oliver on most mocks, so I don't expect it to be much of a surprise. He's got almost everything you want in a corner except height and length, and he makes up for it with bravado, toughness, instincts, ball skills, and well... tick off everything else you're looking for in a CB, cause he's got it. I hate that he falls to the Vikings, of all teams.",30,Minnesota,1,1.30,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Texans,Jalyn Holmes,DE,Ohio State,"I admit he could go a lot higher than this, he's just such a versatile guy and his upside is pretty much limitless. I've seen a lot of people wonder where his production was but I don't think that's necessarily a fair criticism. You have to think of Ohio State defensive linemen the same way you think of the Eagles defensive linemen. They rotate (and move around) so much it's hard to put up huge numbers. We all know Fletcher Cox is a star, for instance, but he only had 5.5 sacks and 26 tackles last year (I suppose the sack totals are pretty good for a tackle but you get the idea). Same with the Ohio State guys. Holmes rotated, or flexed inside sometimes, and his numbers weren't what they could have been. So I think he might drop because teams won't know what he is. Is he a big end in a 4 3? An undersized tackle? Can he hold up as a traditional 5 tech in a 3 4? I don't know, but I say it pushes him down the board some, right into the hands of a team that knows just how to use him. 3",98,Houston,3,3.34,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Texans,Jamarco Jones,OT,Ohio State,"Every once in awhile the narrative we've all created together takes over and the delineation between prospects becomes too black and white. I blame the combine, mostly. Take the OT class for instance. If you watch the tape, there's no way you put a guy like Brian O'Neill (who I like, FWIW) ahead of Jones. Yes, he's got some physical traits that are enticing and he's got lots of upside as a guy who hasn't played the position long, but where's his floor? It's basically in the basement. And yet he shows out at the combine and all of a sudden he's a borderline first rounder. Same with Kolton Miller (who actually has better tape than O'Neill). Those guys may or may not turn out to be better pros, but are they really that different as prospects than Jones? No way. Sure, Jones might not have their ceilings, but he's got a higher floor than both of them, and there's something to be said for guys with high floors. It's like fantasy football the most important thing in the first couple of rounds is not busting. The NFL draft isn't quite so rigid in its approach to adding talent (they have more than one year for things to pan out), but it's also prone to guys exceeding their ceilings (or plummeting past their floors). So I don't know if Jones is ever gonna make any pro bowls, but I'm pretty sure he's gonna have a long, productive career, and I think he's great value this late. And given the Texans' tackle needs, this feels like a perfect marriage. Which is why they had to pay something of a premium to get up here.

Broncos,James Daniels,OG/C,Iowa,"Alright, so hear me out Broncos fans, I know a lot of you are probably still steaming from the Vea pick, and I know you guys don't need a center, Paradis is one of the most underrated guys in the league. But Elway tends to draft the guys he meets with especially in the early rounds and while I think you guys should be in for one of the guard/tackle hybrids like Tyrell Crosby, Elway didn't meet with him (though the Broncos staff did coach Crosby in the Senior Bowl, so maybe we can't use his visit list like we would have in the past). In fact the only linemen he's met with are a bunch of low round guys, Martinas Rankin (who is a guard/tackle hybrid but not worth this high of a pick) and James Daniels. And call it a hunch, I think he loves James Daniels, perhaps because I love him too. He's one of my two or three favorite players in the draft. If I was running the Lions war room he'd be my pick in the first. But alas, I'm not, and I don't expect Quinn to have Daniels above Carter, let alone Hubbard or Evans or Payne or any number of other guys. C'est la vie. Now obviously I don't think the Broncos are drafting him to play center, at least not at first (though Paradis's contract is out after this year) but he's the kind of athlete who comes around at center maybe once a generation, which is why everyone's pigeon holing him as a zone guy. I mean, yeah, he'd dominate in a zone, but to call him just a zone guy is shortsighted.

Cardinals,James Washington,WR,Oklahoma State,"It's clear to me based on your offseason moves, Cards fans, that your plan is a long term one. Start building around some young guys and shed the big contracts (Mathieu and Veldheer), position yourselves so you have a ton of cap space next summer. Get a good look at what Bradford can do (and to a lesser extent Glennon), what Lamar Jackson can do in practice. Add some guys in the draft and restrict your long term FA signings to the younger guys (Pugh), plug some other guys in short term, see how they work out (Andre Smith, Josh Bynes). Give the new coaches time to start installing their schemes and shaping the roster the way they want it, start developing your rookies. Clear the cap out for 2019. If you cut Bethea, Gresham and Peters after the season, that gives you around $95 million in cap space. Don't bring Bradford back and it goes up to $115. 2018's not gonna be the best season but you knew that already.

Cardinals,James Washington,WR,Oklahoma State,"Arizona grabbed their future QB with Lamar, but now he needs some weapons. Larry continues to defy Father Time, but there's really nothing else aside from him. Lamar has a quality arm, and pairing that with an excellent deep threat like James Washington could lead to a big payoff. Wahsington is a physical deep-ball receiver with excellent ball tracking. His absurd 20 YPC in college only speaks. He has pretty quality game speed and great hands which he uses to high point deep balls. Lamar's escapability combined with his downfield capabilities could be quite the pairing.",47,Arizona,2,2.15,1tjRGL5x00edczECWbeNCH6qeZeDSG886Lxls8-yUq8g

Colts,Jamil Demby,OG/OT,Maine,"I know someone like Duke Ejiofor or even Braden Smith or Wyatt Teller would have been more exciting, Colts fans, but by the fourth round our teams are often drafting guys where we're like, huh? Shit, for a lot of us it's happening in the 3rd round. And FWIW re Demby vs. Smith/Teller, I think 90% of FOs are gonna grade Demby out higher. He's better athlete and has a much higher upside, he might even be a better player right now. Also, unlike Teller, he has the ability to flex out to tackle. He's gonna take some time to adjust, just like every small school guy does, but Indy's one of the best places to go for guys that need time to adjust. Like I said, I think this is at least a two year rebuild and I think your FO knows it, even if they won't call it that. Demby's got surprisingly light feet for a guy who's almost 6'5 and 323 pounds, he has no problem reaching the second level, he's great against stunts and twists (one of the main things I look at in an interior lineman), and he looked great at the Senior Bowl, one of the better o",113,Indianapolis,4,4.13,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Broncos,Javon Wims,WR,Georgia,"It might seem a little high based on the current mocks/grades, but I'm thinking this is about where he's gonna come off the board. Plus, it's the fourth round. Like half the picks are gonna seem too high, that's just how it goes. But Wims has too many gifts not to go higher than we think, and my hunch is if Denver tries to wait until their fifth round picks, he'll be gone. Wims is still a relative newcomer to the game despite playing at such a high level in college, and at 6'6, 215, he's gonna keep GMs up at night fantasizing about fades and back shoulder throws and maybe even a couple of blocked kicks, as a rookie. He's not a guy who gets wide open very often, but then, neither is Deandre Hopkins, and Wims has some similarly sticky hands. I'm not saying they're Hopkins level hands he may have the best hands I've ever seen, him or Fitz but he's that kind of guy. He's in that category. He'll be great as a rookie as Keenum's jump ball option, I expect him to be useful early on in that respect. There are quite a few similar guys expected to go around here",118,Denver,4,4.18,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Colts,Jerome Baker,LB,Ohio State,"The mantra in Indianapolis is to get faster on defense, and after watching Baker slide towards the end of the third, they decide it's worth it to go up and get him. It costs them a fourth, fifth and sixth to do it, but they've added other picks through the trades they've made throughout the draft, so they can stomach it. Some teams are gonna have as high as a second round grade on Baker, I expect, and Indy strikes me as one who might, given how much they intend to value speed at LB (and Atlanta doesn't have a fifth rounder, and given that Indy's picks are at the top of each round, it's kinda like they're a round higher). Of course they're not the only team valuing speed at LB, so Baker's slight fall is somewhat surprising. Well here's what I was thinking most of the teams looking for speed at LB want a guy who can cover backs and TEs. Baker's one of the fastest LBs, but he really, really struggled covering backs and TEs this past year. Now, maybe that was because he was asked to do something different within the Ohio State scheme, because in 2016 he looked fine. I wouldn't call him lockdown, but he was certainly better in 2016 than 2017. So what happened? Lots of Ohio State fans I've spoken with contend he was asked to do something different within the scheme, but that's not a consensus. And besides, pro teams are gonna ask him to do something different too, it's no reason to go from decent at something to terrible. That combined with questions about his instincts causes him to fall. But we all know Indy wants the fast guys, and they'll give Baker plenty of time to learn a new scheme and adjust to the pro game. He and Edmunds are gonna cover a ton of ground.",90,Indianapolis,3,3.26,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs
Bengals,Jerome Baker,OLB,Ohio St.,"Baker is a rangy LB who can run the field, tackle well, and cover RBs and TEs. Sounds like a first round pick.

Panthers,Jessie Bates,S,Wake Forest,"The Panthers FO is dancing in the streets at the way this went down (while the Steelers FO glowers behind their french fry sandwiches for the second year in a row... or do they?). I imagine they've been chewing their fingernails off while they've watched names come off the board, hoping one of Harrison or Bates would drop to them as they really don't have the ammunition to move up. And I thought about it, Panthers fans, I did. I kept looking at the board and saying to myself, if someone wants Jessie, they're probably gonna have to jump above the Panthers to get him. And if I know it, NFL FOs surely know it too. But I couldn't make it happen. Either no one had the ammo or they had other positions they wanted to address first. Lucky for you guys. I mean really, the Panthers might not be done at safety after this, that's how dire their need is. What is it, Mike Adams and Colin Jones right now? Colin Adams and Mike Jones? Danorris Byrd Cox and Damiere Southward Searcy? I'm just throwing names at a wall here, maybe something will stick. Bates is one of the draft's true free safeties, a rangy guy who covers a lot of ground with his gazelle strides. He's tall and skinny and not the greatest tackler in the world, but what's important is he's willing, so that should improve. Anyway he'll get plenty of chances, and don't freak out if he struggles for awhile, Panthers fans.

Rams,John Kelly,RB,Tennessee,"So what happens to the Rams offense if, fate forbid, Todd Gurley gets hurt? I've always liked Malcolm Brown (own him on a couple of dynasty fantasy leagues), but do we really know what kind of player he is? He's looked pretty good in some preseason games and from reports, in practice as well, but the league is littered with practice squad guys who fit that same description. And thus far at least, Brown hasn't translated that production into regular season performance, averaging just 3.6 YPC on 85 career carries. That doesn't seem like the kind of guy you ride into the season with as your main backup. Kelly's a guy a lot of people love, and it's hard not to watching his smash mouth tape. He doesn't seem like a great athlete (and he didn't really test like one either), but he's got that little sideways glide that looks like it might play in the league, he's a good pass catcher so the Rams wouldn't have to adjust their offense too much with him in, and toughness like his is always welcome. But he's a 205 pound grinder, and there's not a lot of guys like him in the league, he'll have to buck some history to find success (and Phillip Lindsay as a 190 pound grinder will *really have to buck that history, but that doesn't really have anything to do with this pick, I just wanted to mention it).",135,Los Angeles,4,4.35,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Broncos,Joseph Noteboom,OT,TCU,"They've already added Daniels to the line but he won't help much if Veldheer doesn't pan out, or if he or Bolles gets hurt. They still need to add a tackle, and Noteboom's a guy who's gonna intrigue a lot of FOs. He's a high upside play who could feasibly go a lot higher than this. He's also a difficult evaluation just like most of the guys in those janky Big 12 offenses, but he looked great at the Senior Bowl, and he's got everything you look for athletically from a tackle. He's got some iffy tape, his technique's all over the place, his stance is whack and he can get a little grabby. But he's strong and a good athlete, and he holds his own with edge rushers better than some of the good technicians, let alone someone with his deficiencies.

Cleveland is in desperate need of a franchise QB, but with Tyrod Taylor in the fold, they have the oppurtuntiy to bank on Josh Allen's boom or bust potential and let him develop for a bit.

defense is getting older with a less than spectacular offense to speak of. 
I do think it will be good for Allen to sit a few games or even all of the

Allen will have solid weapons when he takes over the job, and hopefully, the Broncos will have put the necessary resources into improving their OL by the time he takes over. Allen has only helped himself this offseason. He looked great in the second half of the Senior Bowl, and he followed that by flashing his big arm and interviewing well at the Combine.

It makes sense for any team with a decent bridge QB to invest in him potential.

So when I see all these mocks sending a CB to the Panthers in the first, I'm usually like, I don't think so. Not only do I think their need is less than most people think it is, but the Panthers don't have a long history of drafting corners in the first (twice in their history, the last time in 2004). But then most of those CBs being mocked to the Panthers weren't Josh Jackson. Because you have to admit, Panthers fans, that whether or not corner is your biggest need, it could still use some addressing. I just don't think you'd do it in the first unless the guy you picked was BPA. Well to me, and I expect to a lot of FOs, Jackson will be BPA here. I mentioned earlier how I think FOs are gonna be a little higher on him than we are cause he's a DB that makes plays. That's important. You hear how coaching staffs are always harping on turnovers, turnovers, turnovers. Well Jackson is probably the best defensive playmaker in the draft. He reminds me of Marcus Peters that way (except he's not a chump). He baits, he attacks the ball, he makes, ahem, educated guesses. He plays the position like a receiver. He's not the athlete Peters is, but he allayed a lot of fears that he was a bad one with his testing. And we know the Panthers have met with him. Sure, maybe they have more glaring needs at safety (though they've never drafted a safety in the first) and along the interior OL, but both of those classes are deep.

This organization has longed for a quality corner opposite Pat Pete for a while now, but they’ve never been able to find more than a short-term stopgap. I think that stops here with Josh Jackson. Steve Wilks is going to bring his zone coverage scheme from Carolina over to Arizona, and that’s the absolute perfect system for a CB with Jackson’s skillset.

Dolphins,Josh Rosen,QB,UCLA,"And now we come to the coach who got the most out of Cutler the dick QB. Adam Gase might be the best coach for Rosen. As much as that whole Jim Mora thing got blown out of proportion, I think he's right about Rosen needing to be challenged. I think the same was true of Cutler. And I think Gase might like being challenged too, he's like the millennial version of a coach who's not really a millennial but he's young and hip so whatever, he might as well be. I doubt too many of you Dolphins fans will like this (and probably you Bills fans either), but no fanbase likes it when they give up a lot of draft capital to move up and take their guy, I mean, not most of them anyway. Chiefs fans were pretty pissed last year when it happened, and while your everyday Texans fan was probably a little happier given their need and Watson's name recognition, on here at least fire was shooting out of their eyes. Now, both fanbases are pretty happy about it. I have a hunch Baker is the Dolphins guy but Rosen is probably right there with him, and he's a good fit. I expect the Colts will have been looking at Barkley and Chubb, and with both of those guys gone, trading down makes sense. And I expect the Dolphins to give them the best offer. They just seem like a FO that's more willing to overpay than the Bills to me. The Cardinals might kick the tires too, but trading with the Dolphins drops the Colts down the least amount of spots, and I imagine with the next batch of guys they're considering, that's important.",6,Miami,1,1.6,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

franchise QB for another 5 years. Eli Manning is still a functioning QB
and he will most likely start a few games but don't be surprised to see him
shipped out before the trade deadline in favor of Rosen. Speaking of
Rosen, he is one of the most mechanically sound quarterbacks to come 
out of the draft in the past 5-10 years. His footwork and throwing motion
is nearly flawless which puts him ahead of any other QB in this draft

Jets,Josh Rosen,QB,UCLA,"(Let me preface this by saying that I don't buy into the rumor that the Giants only like Darnold with the number 2 spot and will pick a non-QB if he's not there.) This pick is the most intruiging in the entire draft. The Giants could select Saquon Barkley (an amazing talent), Quenton Nelson (another amazing talent who fills a huge hole), they could trade down with Buffalo and acquire a metric fuckton of picks, or they can select a franchise QB to succeed Eli Manning. I'm going to be honest, I have no idea what they'll do, but I think it would benefit them the most to select their quarterback of the future. They look to find just that in Josh Rosen. Rosen is my favorite quarterback in this year's draft; he is an accurate, intelligent, pro-ready quarterback who will have an immediate impact on any team that picks him. Watching his tape, I don't know why Rosen isn't the consensus number 1 pick. Rosen goes to New York and will be chosen to sit for a while until groomed into the Giants' franchise guy.",2,New York,1,1.2,1xJej0pjtovSUSD4Lop28QNsClJEzGt0S1y_g3bjzW8w

My guess is that they trade up again with Indianapolis, then trade from that pick to #2. The Giants probably don’t want to trade directly from #2 to #12, but they might be comfortable to settle in at #6 with Darnold off the board. If Buffalo works their way into this spot, the question becomes which QB they’ll take. Allen? Rosen? Mayfield? There are no clues regarding who they would lean towards here, but Buffalo needs someone who can come in and start right away. Allen is more of a project where Rosen is already a polished passer.

Jets,Josh Rosen,QB,UCLA,This pick is so valuable that there's no good reason for the Giants not to trade it. They're clearly in win now mode and trading this pick would allow them to still get a very good player this season while also setting themselves up for a rich future draft. If they do decide to stay then there's no doubt it will be for a QB. Rosen is my #1 QB in this draft and I think he's significantly better than anyone left.

Cowboys,Josh Sweat,DE,Florida State,"Remember when I said in the intro to this thing how most fanbases were gonna like half their picks and hate half their picks? That's how most of us feel after the draft (until we talk ourselves into all of them) and I'm thinking by the end of this thing, the Cowboys are gonna be the example I use. I may even go back and amend it. The reason everyone was so surprised when the Cowboys took Taco Charlton last year was that he wasn't a fit as a RDE in their system. That position had traditionally been manned by a smaller, speedier guy; Charlton, at 6'6 275 pounds, was anything but. There was the thought that maybe they'd changed the way they do things by playing Jack Crawford at RDE some in 2016, but I'm thinking they may want to take a mulligan (not necessarily on the Charlton pick, but on the style). You can never have enough guys who get pressure, and outside of Lawrence, Dallas doesn't have enough of them. Now though the Cowboys don't have a traditional RDE on their roster and though we don't know how the Lawrence saga is gonna play out long term, they're pretty deep at end (and not so deep at ILB, OT/OG, DT, etc...). So I'm sure you Cowboys fans just like the fans of every team who's picked since Price went want me to plug Ragnow in here. (Edit or now that Dez is gone, a receiver) And you guys actually have a legitimate argument. Ragnow and Jerry are Razorback bros, and Jerry's shown no hesitation in drafting an interior lineman high (to great success too, I might add). In fact I thought it made so much sense, I put it in, then I started writing this explanation, then I started having second thoughts. I don't know, maybe I rate Cameron Fleming more so than you guys, but I actually think he's pretty good. And he'll allow Collins to flex back to guard where he should be playing anyway. And that right there is the best offensive line in the league. Now I'll give you, your depth is bad, and it was that bad depth that ruined your season last year, and if you guys were maybe one player away, maybe addressing that depth in the second round would make sense. But you're not one player away, you're like four players away (which is still much closer than most), and in a draft that's deep in linemen, I can't in good conscious believe Jerry won't be talked out of Ragnow by his people for a higher profile, harder",57,Dallas,2,2.25,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Dolphins,Justin Jones,DT,North Carolina State,"I know Dolphins fans consider the DT position to be a team weakness, but I actually think they've got a little something cooking. I thought Godchaux had a great rookie season and Vincent Taylor flashed too. Phillips has been so so overall, I admit, but he did improve quite a bit in 2017 and I think his best is still to come. But they are thin and inexperienced and it would do them some good to add another body to the mix. Enter Justin Jones, who I think is one of the underrated gems of the class, and the only reason he's available this late, IMO, is that he doesn't wow you with any one thing. His hands are active and strong but not vicious, his technique is sound but not stellar, he gets good leverage and plays with a strong base most of the time, his spin move is solid when he's rushing the passer, but not elite. He's just a solid player in every aspect, and that's an underrated trait in a fourth rounder, to find a floor as high as Jones's. He also plays with a high motor and is willing to do the dirty work for his teammates, namely against double teams, which he has a knack for splitting.

Redskins,Justin Reid,S,Stanford,"This is one of those where, when they announce the trade, the media machine is gonna barf out a quick narrative about how the Redskins traded up for their guy, foregone conclusion Payne this, Payne that, and then shocker! It happens all the time, but the best example was when the Dolphins hopped into the top 5 back in 2013 and the cognoscenti started running video of Lane Johnson and he’s the pick and he has to be, and then he wasn’t, it was Dion Jordan (it turns out the Dolphins should have listened to the cognoscenti). Washington needs a DT to stuff the run, and if you’re drafting Payne to stuff the run, you’re not drafting him for the right reasons. That was his role with Alabama for most of the season, and for most of the season, he looked like a mid rounder. It wasn’t until Saban cut him loose in the playoffs that we got an idea what he could really do, but that's not the guy the Redskins need. They’ve got that guy, a few of them,  starting with Payne’s former teammate Jonathan Allen. So the move up’s not for Payne, it’s for draft darling Justin Reid. The Redskins added third and fifth round picks from their trade haul with the Chargers in the first round, so they don't mind giving up their fourth to move up seven spots to grab one of the draft's surprise fallers. I think going into the draft their plan was probably to snag a RB in the first two rounds, but you have to adjust to the board as it falls, and it fell kinda weird for them. Guice went before they thought he would in the first, Reid falls further than they thought he would in the second. So they go up and grab him. It makes the loss of Derwin James and the decision to pass on Minkah more palatable. From the Colts perspective, they recoup a pick they used to go up and get Maurice Hurst. Now I know some of you Redskins fans are gonna be hammering me for coming out of the first two rounds with a DE and S and no DT, RB or interior lineman, but my belief is when elite talent's available, you take it, especially when it's at a position that's not stacked. It's why they (and you) were so willing to grab Minkah or James in the first. They stood out above the talent around them, and I think the same's true of Reid in the second. And there's always the two third round picks coming up.",37,Washington,2,2.5,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Well I'll tell you what gives despite his freaky athleticism, Turay didn't produce. It's the classic story of the third rounder, the guy with all the gifts and none of the output (not to be confused with the story of another kind of third rounder, the guy with all of the output and none of the gifts). I've talked to a couple of Rutgers fans who are genuinely angry with Turay. They can't fathom how a guy like that",87,Los Angeles,3,3.23,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Jets,Kerryon Johnson,RB,Auburn,"Oh, this one breaks my heart Giants fans. I was so hoping he'd fall to the Lions pick in the third. It's literally hard for me to write this. Kerryon's my #1 draft crush, he's the guy I think we'll be looking back on and wondering 'man, why didn't he go higher?' Well, a few reasons. His injury history plays a part, for sure, and his long speed's not the greatest, but what he does well he does as well as anyone in the draft. I think he's the best goal line back you can get. He's not built like the best goal line back (though he's not a small guy, either), he just has that knack for finding the end zone. The way Marcus Allen did back in the day, or Tomlinson or Charles more recently. You don't have to be the biggest guy in the world to slither through creases and understand the most likely ways to fall forward a yard. It's an intuitive thing, and I think Johnson has it. I also think he's one of the best pass catching backs in the draft, and we all know how the league wants their back to catch passes now. And just look at his production in the SEC. He was going against NFL talent week in and week out and succeeding enough that he was named offensive player of the year. Don't tell me doesn't have what it takes for the pros, that's ridiculous. He literally passed the best test a RB can get from the college ranks with flying colors. And it's gonna keep happening. Congrats Giants fans, you've crushed me. I'm sure some of you might prefer Nick Chubb, and all I can say to those of you thinking that way is, you're wrong. I mean, probably. Maybe. I do think NFL FOs are higher on Kerryon than most of us are, you can see it when you look at the ratings of former scouts.

Chiefs,Kevin Toliver,CB,LSU,"Toliver's gonna go higher than you think. He's got that LSU CB pedigree, and while his time at Baton Rouge wasn't as successful as evaluators would have liked, he did show some improvement in 2017, and he's got the freaky size and athleticism teams can't get enough of. If his play ever matches his talent, watch out! He's no nickel back, but Fuller can shift inside easy enough while this tree lines up outside. And the Chiefs gotta get somebody else for the outside, they just gotta. Otherwise it's Amerson and Keith Reaser and (shudder) Steve Nelson lining up next to Fuller, and that's a recipe for a lot of shootouts. Gonna have to grab Mahomie in fantasy this year, I think. Toliver falls mostly because of his up and down play, but also because he's a bit of a punk, apparently. But if NFL teams avoided 20 23 year old punks, they wouldn't be able to fill out their rosters. Guys mature. And if he is a punk, I like the chances of the guys on your D straightening him out and getting him to channel that punkitude into usefulness. Harness it, don't squelch it. Some of the best players in the league came into it as punks, and KC's never been afraid of them (sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't).",86,Kansas City,3,3.22,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Colts,Kolton Miller,OT,UCLA,"I expect Colts fans would have liked to address the OL before now, and I tried a couple of times, truly, the board just didn't fall the right way. Still, given how high I've seen Miller going in some of these mocks recently, this has to feel like a pretty good get at this point. I wouldn't be shocked if, by the end of the draft, the Colts have added two more offensive linemen, they have to keep Andrew Luck healthy. There's still great value left in the interior, but the tackle spot is starting to thin out a little bit, and Miller represents one of the last guys you might be able to plug in this year. I'm actually a little higher on some of the other guys' upside but there's no doubt Miller has the higher floor, and if he has a career like Solder, the guy he's most often compared with, I think the Colts would be pretty damn happy about it. And I don't think there's that much difference anymore between left and right tackles, either. So drafting Miller to plug in on the right is no problem, or if it is you just flip them. It's about getting the two best guys on the field.",49,Indianapolis,2,2.17,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

That ends with Kolton Miller. Miller needs to add a little more weight to his frame to play RT in a man blocking scheme, but all that comes down to is coaching. If Miller develops nicely, there’s even a chance he’s the long-term answer to Donald Penn at LT, which would feel two needs with one guy for the Raiders.

Broncos,Kyle Lauletta,QB,Richmond,"OK, maybe this is cheating a little to get Lauletta to Denver in a spot where I can talk about it. I do expect him to come off the board really soon, and I expect Denver will have to trade up to get him, and I think they will. That said, if Tennessee was offered this trade, I very much think they'd take it, it works out quite a bit in their favor, but you know what they say, you have to pay a premium to move up for a QB. I think the Broncos really like Lauletta. I think they like him (and Falk) enough to pass on QB with their first round pick in hopes they can get him, though I doubt they like him enough to draft him before this. QBs, once we move past the first grouping of them, tend to go a little later than we think. Remember all the mocks that had Brad Kaaya going in the 2 4th last year? He lasted until the very end of the sixth. We were all sure Vernon Adams was the next Russ, he went undrafted. Tyler Bray went undrafted. Lots of people posited that Josh Dobbs would be the best QB in last year's class and had him going in the second. He went around here, towards the end of the fourth. Dak went around here. It's a hot spot for QBs. I think Lauletta's lack of arm strength is gonna cap his draft position, it's a legit worry for any team drafting him. He's got the intangibles we all love he's kind of the anti Rosen, actually",137,Denver,4,4.37,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Bengals,Kyzir White,S,West Virginia,"White's a guy who was talked about as a borderline first round pick early in the process, but his inability to go through all the testing has him slipping a little, much to Cincy's benefit. This is the kind of hard hitting safety every fanbase loves, he flies around with little regard for his own well being and hits and hits and hits. It's no surprise then that he's better in the box, and in fact some think he's well on his way to transitioning into that hybrid role that's become all the rage, safety some of the time, linebacker some of the time, blankets tight ends and running backs, really quick at recognizing play action. He's a great blitzer too, I'm worried he's gonna kill a QB one day. He lets 'em know he's been there, sheesh. I suppose that means he might also get some roughing the passer penalties, but that's the sort of risk you run when you attack the QB the way he does. He was West Virginia's captain too, and I would have high hopes, if I were you Bengals fans, of your new defensive coordinator Teryl Austin turning him into something.

Cardinals,Lamar Jackson,QB,Louisville,"My hunch is the Cardinals would prefer to make this trade with the Colts, but I think the Colts would ask for the moon to trade down yet again. As it is the Cardinals first and second round picks are already an overpay, they don't want to give any more than that. So they buzz Gruden & Co. to assess their willingness to trade down, and find themselves pleasantly surprised by their response. Because if you look at the Raiders most glaring needs OT, DT, MLB, maybe a WR (unless they sign Dez, don't rule it out)... those can all be had further down the board. In fact most of them would be a reach here. I have a hunch Gruden would love a guy like Vea, but Vea's off the board, so there's not as much reason to stick around. Minkah will give them pause, especially since Alabama's former DB coach now has the same position with the Raiders, but I can't imagine them having much problem adding a second round pick to drop down five spots. As for the pick, so here's the thing about Jackson 75% of the league may have him as a guy they wouldn't touch until late, or even someone that should switch positions. But we've all heard it said there only has to be one team that believes in his ability to take him, and my hunch is there'll be more than one team. You can see it in the sub. For every ten people who trash Jackson's game, there's two or three who defend him. I think roughly the same ratio will play out league wide. Because if Jackson can put it all together, he could absolutely set the league on fire, I don't think anyone's really debating that. The debate rages on whether or not he'll actually put it all together. But remember last year, with Watson and Mahomes? We didn't think they'd go this high, but they did, and right around here too. My hunch is Arizona and Wilks especially like what they see in Jackson. He comes from Carolina, where Cam and the Panthers success was based more on what he could do physically than his pinpoint passing. I know, I know, Cardinals offensive coordinator Mike McCoy likes his QBs big, stationary, and prototypical, but I think that actually works in favor of this pick. In Arizona, he's guaranteed to be able to sit, if not behind the oft injured Bradford then behind Glennon. In that time, he can go to McCoy prototypical QB school and iron out some of his kinks while McCoy plays around with Bradford and Glennon. I do think he could set the league on fire if they played him, but at the cost of his development. He can still set the league on fire in a couple of years.",10,Arizona,1,1.10,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Arizona needs something to keep themselves afloat in the NFC, and I could see them gambling on Lamar Jackson. Lamar is a playmaker both through the air and on the ground, pairing a quality arm with solid ball placement with the threat of him taking off and running.

good prospects in the draft and wait another year to get their QB and

athleticism at the QB position and how much he has improved at

They still have another first, one second, and two thirds after this move, so they aren’t hurting their chances of filling other holes by making this trade, like other teams would be. Moving on to Lamar Jackson, he’s fairly unrefined, but that’s more so in a mental capacity than in a physical one. He already improved significantly as a passer this past season at Louisville. For that reason, I think it’s fair to say an NFL team can get even more out of him. At least, enough to where they can build a successful offense that suits his skill set. The area Jackson has the most work to do in is the mental aspects of reading defenses. Due to not making pro-level reads in college, Jackson isn’t a guy I’d feel comfortable starting right away, but the Bills have already signed their contingency plan in A.J. McCarron.

I thinkthe Cardinals can't just sit around and hope Lamar Jackson will make it to them, that's too risky. And trading with the Raiders makes the most sense because they wont want to trade up too high, but any lower and they run the risk of the Dolphins drafting him or the Ravens/Chargers/Bengals/Patriots or whoever trading up to get him. Just not worth it when you are in such a desperate need at the Position and you answer is sitting right there 5 picks ahead of you. This is a good match right here.",10,Arizona,1,1.10,1ZZEIc9E3Erbvdpwyx_UyD-Cko3GIlSDGjv0VgbQoXzY
Bills,Lamar Jackson,QB,Louisville,"Buffalo needs a QB is probably the most obvious thing about this entire draft process. There is no smokescreen attempt, no trying to hide it. Before it's all said and done i think they trade up to either 2 or 4 for Allen or Rosen. If that doesn't get done then much like Denver i think they settle for the last QB worth a 1st Rd pick.",12,Buffalo,1,1.12,2PACX-1vQaJ75impLnpt-FuRLFee4e7g_nXU8papwdHb3NdC8VZ63y-wKu8_7PnHUIKEYkcVmQM16S3btjX112
Bills,Lamar Jackson,QB,Louisville,If Buffalo trades the farm to Cleveland at 4 and grabs Rosen they'll quickly forget about last years playoffs because they'll be a main stay in them. If they don't and settle for Jackson i still think they'll feel pretty good. Jackson is the opposite of Allen. A lot of professional draft guys aren't too high on him but draft fans everywhere love him for what he can do. He really is a phenomenal athlete and if he can stay healthy he's gonna be exciting to watch in Buffalo.,12,Buffalo,1,1.12,2PACX-1vS3E77cIsMDiZ7A3Y767Vss7iURj-JrgxlGspQkbwX7MNzMnJui-xKiHZwENQoqpLIKlJtG4DZNtusK
Packers,Leighton Vander Esch,LB,Boise State,"Based on that leaked top 15 board last week, I think we might be underrating Vander Esch, slightly, as a community. I mean I know it was just one team, but it's not so difficult to imagine other teams having him that high, given we've all got him in the latter third of the first round ourselves. It's not that big of a jump. And he just happens to perfectly fit the Packers' player profile. Vander Esch is a late riser, for sure, and there's some questionable tape on him out there. But what's interesting about the tape is just how much improvement you see as the year goes along, until the bowl game against Oregon when he set the scouting world on fire. If he keeps improving at that kind of rate he'll be up with the Wagners and Kuechlys in no time. Much to this Lions' fan's chagrin.",14,Green Bay,1,1.14,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Lions,Lorenzo Carter,LB/DE,Georgia,"Call it a hunch, but I think Quinn and Patricia are pretty high on Carter. We've met with him twice, and he brings the kind of versatility they're gonna look for in a front seven guy. With Carter you don't have to worry about him dropping into coverage (the way you would, say, Landry), he did it a lot at Georgia, he has a lot of experience doing linebackery things. And he's strong as an ox for his frame, he'll have no problem setting the edge. He just doesn't put up the flashy sack numbers, but he didn't have nearly as much opportunity as some of the other edge guys, either. Maybe there's room for growth? He's certainly got the freaky athleticism for it. He could even flex inside now and again as a Tremaine Edmunds style ILB. I think he's a defensive weapon, a matchup nightmare, and I think he's just the sort of guy Quinn and Patricia are looking for. Now I expect some of my fellow Lions fans will be pretty peeved about me passing on Payne, but I think he's in for something of an A'Shawn Robinson style draft day tumble. We're one of the teams that could end it (I think he fits better with us than most), and I think we might have, had Carter not been available. But I also think Quinn and Patricia like our DTs better than we do. I know that's borderline sacrilege, but it's the way I see it. Patricia squeezed more out of less in New England than he had any right to, and while I don't think we intend to go exactly that route, I think they believe in themselves to find guys later on that will work. Guys like the guys we have now. I don't think they'd keep us from upgrading if the right guy was around Vea, for example",23,Detroit,1,1.23,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Patriots,Luke Falk,QB,Washington State,"Sidebar Here's reason #767 why I think Belichick's a genius I think he uses the bargains he can get with young/rookie defensive linemen the same way other teams use the bargains they can get with a rookie QB. I'll explain. What are the NFL's highest paid positions? QB, obviously, then I'd say DE, LT and CB, on the whole. There are outliers at other positions, but for the most part if you have good players at QB, DE, LT and CB, you're paying them a lot. Unless they're on rookie contracts. So I'm sure you've all noticed how the Rams have been able to stack their roster during the offseason, just like the Eagles stacked theirs too. They can only do that cause their QBs are on rookie contracts. That's shit's like NFL gold. But, and here's the dilemma, once Goff and Wentz get paid, the Rams and Eagles are gonna have to start cutting guys left and right. As an obvious example, look at what's happened to the Seahawks. You remember how loaded their roster was during their Super Bowl run and shortly thereafter. Wilson was making peanuts, so they could afford to bring in FAs like Avril and Bennett and Chris Clemons and Red Bryant and pay Lynch and Baldwin and Chancellor and Wright and Sherman. Until Wilson's rookie contract was up and they had to pay him instead. Now look what's happening to them. That same fate will befall the Rams and Eagles soon enough. There's no avoiding paying a QB once you get a good one. But what if you could find a bargain somewhere else? OK, so the Patriots have to pay Brady, there's no way around it. But what if they chinced at DE? It wouldn't give them the same kind of savings they'd get at QB, but it would still be a lot. So how would you go about doing it? Well, just like at QB, you get guys on rookie contracts, they're the best bargains in the league. And you hope they play their asses off. Then, if they become one of the best DEs in the league, instead of signing them to a long contract the way you'd have to sign a QB, you ship them off for good draft picks and start the process over again. Or, see Chandler Jones (and to a lesser extent Jamie Collins, who was more of a LB with edge qualities). It's a much more repeatable thing at DE, because you can afford to throw so many more numbers at it. Take this draft alone, here I have them drafting Ejiofor after already drafting Sweat. You'd never draft two QBs at the same spots, for a whole buncha reasons, one of the main ones being they couldn't both see the field. As for the other expensive positions, Belichick has clearly decided CB has more value as he's willing to pay those, but he tends to keep it manageable at LT too. So there's your value. It's not a QB on a rookie contract. It's DE's on rookie contracts (or vets on reasonable ones), and a LT on a rookie/reasonable contract. That's why the turnover is so great on the NE D Line. He can't get out from under paying Brady, so he finds some other way to do it. Sorry for the digression, I just wanted to get that off my chest. In an earlier version of this thing I had the Pats nabbing a DE and wrote that then, when it would have made much more sense, but I liked it and wanted to share it, so I crammed it in here. Anyway, everyone's all hung up on how Lauletta's a Pats style QB (he even played lacrosse!), or how Belichick loves Mike White (warning, if you hear Belichick loves someone before the draft, do not believe it) and Mason Rudolph. When I hear all that stuff, my inclination is to think 'OK, who's the guy we're *not hearing about?' To me, that guy is much more likely to be Belichick's target. And this year, that guy is Luke Falk. So you have to ask yourself then, does Falk seem like the kind of guy the Patriots would like? Let's see... accurate, smart, quick release, stands tall and has good feel in the pocket, uses his eyes well to manipulate DBs, good timing on throws, above average arm strength... It's like he was crafted for Belichick in a lab, I don't understand why it's not coming up more often. If you were drafting Falk after his sophomore year, you'd call this a steal than you'd cuss the Patriots for catching all the breaks. Of course that's not how it works, and Falk's work since then leaves a lot to be desired (he even got benched in 2017). The biggest concern is he got so beat up in that janky offense and behind that subpar offensive line that he's got happy feet, that his poise suffered, that he's a real injury risk. It's as if we're evaluating two different guys, and fair enough, those are legitimate concerns. But Belichick's the kinda guy who's gonna see past that, to the guy who looked very poised in the past and know that he can get that guy back, cause he can address the issues that caused the latest version of Falk to appear in the first place. But mostly, and here's this word again, he's gonna see in Falk great value. The kind of guy you wouldn't be able to grab in the fourth if it weren't for extenuating circumstances. And that makes him a Pats kind of pick, current narrative be damned.",96,New England,3,3.32,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs
Patriots,Luke Falk,QB,Washington State,"Might be a small reach in the third round but the Pats don't pick again until the 6th round and I expect the QB pickings to be slim at that point. Falk's QB role model is Tom Brady and has picked up a few of his traits. He is a film junkie and has even dabbled in the TB12 method. Falk has plenty of flaws in his game (Brady did too), but he is a good developmental candidate and probably won't be ready to take over until his third or fourth year anyway",95,New England,3,3.31,12QNCT2421ANRq5Umhkvs5QXVcLT8Xy26fp8dSRSTzs4

Panthers,Malik Jefferson,LB,Texas,"I'm on record as not being the biggest fan of Jefferson's game, but I can admit he did improve drastically this year under Tom Herman. He looked like he was on his way to bustville until Herman showed up and shifted Jefferson's responsibilities away from the middle and more towards the outside, where he could simply attack rather than think. If it's a sign of things to come this could be a real steal. He's got everything you want athletically from a LB, and with Thomas Davis's pending supension and retirement, Carolina has a hole opening up in their corps. Whether they simply plug Jefferson into Davis's spot on the weak side (what I would recommend) or shift Thompson to the weak side and play Jefferson on the strong side, the Panthers will have to be patient. But keep his responsibilities to a minimum and let him attack and you might get more out of him sooner than you think. He's also some sort of saint off the field, working with kids and foundations and charities and ingratiating himself into whatever community he calls home. Panthers fans will love him, at least until he misses his third or fourth assignment. But he's worth the risk at this point.",85,Carolina,3,3.21,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Steelers,Malik Jefferson,LB,Texas,"Shazier's injury created a massive hole in the middle of Pittsburgh's defense, and they need some athleticism back at the ILB position badly. Malik Jefferson is another high-risk high-reward prospect that the Steelers might just need to gamble on. They were very reliant on Shazier's athleticism, and that's exactly what Malik provides. He is incredibly athletic and has the size and strength to match. When he gets going, he can take over games and shut down the run both inside and out. His instincts, however, are sorely lacking. I do think a lot of it is coachable, and the Steelers have good ILB coaching. He was still highly productive at Texas and was a key playmaker at many big moments.",60,Pittsburg,2,2.28,1tjRGL5x00edczECWbeNCH6qeZeDSG886Lxls8-yUq8g

Here's a guy, battled through a quadriceps injury this season, but recovered enough towards the end of the year to post 5.5 sacks in his last seven games. Still, we're all like 'below average athlete who uses his smarts, good technique and a plus motor to create pressure'. OK, we might not all have been like that, but a lot of people were, that's ripped straight from a scouting report. He contended that he still wasn't 100%, but he didn't get an invite to the combine. So his pro day rolls around and he rips off a 4.6 forty at 6'5, 256 pounds. 34 inch vert. Faster 3 cone than Davenport, Key, Armstrong and Chubb. OK, so maybe he's not a below average athlete, maybe he really was hurt, then what? Then you've got a potential star on your hands.

Redskins,Marcus Davenport,DE,UTSA,"The idea when they traded down was to recoup the third rounder, add a fifth rounder, and nab one of James, Davenport, Jackson or Guice (who I think they really, really love, and wouldn't be shocked if they took him at 13). One of them would still be available, and it just so happens there's two. And I know, I know Redskins fans, you want me to include Roquan Smith in that list, but I can't. He's too similar to Zach Brown, he's still a small, chase linebacker who struggles to get off blocks, drafting a guy like that this high just isn't in most GMs DNA, which is why I have him falling. I also expect some of you might want me to include Payne, DT is probably your biggest need position, but I don't think he's a fit. He's not a 0/1 tech the way he's been portrayed, and that's really what you guys need (though maybe you'll sign Hankins, I think that's still in play. Or maybe Phil Taylor can finally stay healthy). If you're drafting Payne to stop the run, you're not gonna get the best out of him, just like Alabama didn't for most of the season. Jackson's a guy I think teams are gonna be a little higher on than we are because of his playmaking skills, but I'm guessing a guy like Davenport's gonna prove irresistible. He's definitely a riskier pick, a high ceiling/low floor guy, but how often can you get a guy with the physical traits to be the best defensive end in the league this low?

I'd probably have them trade some of those 4th/5th/6th rounders since they don't need 13 draft picks, but I'm only doing trades in the 1st, so it is what it is. But the Raiders trading back makes so much sense because as long as they stay in the top 20 they can still get a potentially elite guy. If I would have had them stay at 15 they still could have gotten Minkah, but having them go down to 19 and still getting Davenport, is just insane. Bruce Irvin may play DE this yr, but that doesn't matter because EDGE is a major need. The Raiders need someone on the otherside of Mack because MEJ/Jihad Ward are just not good. Davenport is tier 1 analytically, he has all the neccessary tools. And he showed that he's a nasty Power rusher.

Eagles,Mark Andrews,TE,Oklahoma,"After all their moving around the Colts have a paucity of late round picks, so they have no problem taking a sixth from the Eagles to drop down four spots. As for the Eagles... is TE their #1 need? Nope, not even close. But they're so stacked they're in the enviable position of going mostly BPA, especially when a guy like Andrews falls this far. Now let me be clear, I think he falls this far cause he's a little bit of a JAG at the TE position. Well, JAG's probably a little harsh. It's just I think the things he does well are the same things that guys like Jack Doyle and Cameron Brate do well, and those types of player can be found later in the draft (i.e. Doyle UDFA; Brate UDFA). He's not fast, he doesn't block well, there's no fire to his game, plus he's got the diabetes thing going on (that last one's not necessarily a knock, but it does raise more questions... does the medication make him more lethargic, for example, that sort of thing). He *does appear to have a knack for finding the holes in a defense, but even that might be a product of the offense he played in (and again, you can find guys later with this skill). That said, it's hard to discount his production. He's got good hands and a knack for scoring TDs and he's good at coming down with the ball even when he's covered. The Eagles lost Trey Burton to the Bears in free agency and they released Brent Celek, leaving a good sized hole on their roster behind Zach Ertz. Sure they just added Richard Rodgers, but given Ertz, Celek and Burton all played a lot last year, there's room for another (and that's provided Rodgers gives them anything, he's been pretty quiet as a receiver for the past couple of seasons).",109,Philadelphia,4,4.9,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Bengals,Martinas Rankin,OL,Mississippi State,"Like Crosby, I have a sneaking suspicion teams are higher on Rankin than we think. A lot of that has to do with his visit list, which is vast and expansive. It seems every team wants a piece of him, and I expect that's due to the versatility he brings. How many other guys can play every position along the line? Crosby probably. Williams, maybe? Nelson? Wynn? Notice something they all have in common? Yeah, they've been drafted already. The Bengals are one of the teams that brought Rankin in for a visit, and if there's a couple of things I've learned about the way they do things from perusing their forums and subs, it's 1) they tend to draft guys they've met with, 2) they lean towards better athletes, no more plodders, and 3) they often draft the hype prospects cause they've got a small scouting department. Rankin's got the first two covered but fails at the third hurdle, but I expect if he's hype enough to be brought to HQ, that's good enough. If I'm completely honest, I wanted to have the Bengals trade up to nab Price or Crosby or whoever, but when I looked up GM tendencies... you guys don't trade up very often, do you Cincy fans? I saw a few trade downs sprinkled in, but only four times in the last half century have they ever traded up. That boggles my mind. And most of those were for mid low round picks. Granted one of those times was last year, but it was also only a ten spot move in the sixth round. Anyway, I think it's pretty safe to say Cincy won't be moving up, so they'll have to stay here and grab whoever falls. And we all know adding one more body to the offensive line isn't enough. The Bengals had a true offensive line last year I took offense to it. I expect any self",46,Cincinnati,2,2.14,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Redskins,Mason Cole,OG/C,Michigan,"I doubt the Rams will have too much problem with dropping six spots to recoup one of the sixth round picks they lost in an earlier trade, especially since it's a very slight overpay from the Redskins. Washington has a clear hole at OG (and maybe center), and while I usually don't think NFL teams try to fill their holes in the 4th round, that's not necessarily true of the interior OL. Many of the league's starters came from the 3rd and 4th rounds, so you can draft one here with more than blind hope he might offer something in his rookie season. And Cole's seen his fair share of big games, so he has the experience to step in right away. That's what he did at Michigan, starting as a true freshman at left tackle, so he's used to stepping up quick. The Redskins would have been watching the board and seeing Tennessee coming up soon with a similar need, so they jumped them. Of course it means they're coming out of the first four rounds without filling what many Washington fans think is their primary need at DT, but you're still in the game for Hankins, and of course there's still Phil Taylor, there's always Phil Taylor. I'm sure the Redskins would like to address it but that's not how the board fell, and while there are a few guys available here who are interesting (Folorunso Fatukasi, Kendrick Norton, Derrick Nnadi, Andrew Brown, Bilal Nichols), it's rare for a team to fill a DT need at the end of the fourth round.

Bills,Mason Rudolph,QB,Oklahoma State,"Bills fans have argued the pros and cons of Mason Rudolph until they're blue in the face, so I doubt if I need to get into them here. I do think the Bills FO would like to wait on him, I don't think Rudolph is worth this high of a pick (and I'm an Oklahoma State fan), and I generally don't think the Bills FO is one that exceeds whatever valuation they strap to a guy. But the Pats moves before the draft have to spook them, especially since it's, you know, the hated division rival Pats. New England traded away their first round picks but they still pick again before the Bills do, and if I was the Bills, and knowing Belichick (which I totally don't), I'd be very suspicious of the fact they've shown interest in Rudolph, given they picked right after them when the draft started and have picks before the Bills pick again. Is he being too obvious? Is it a smokescreen for his real intentions, trying to get the Bills to take Rudolph so someone else drops? Or perhaps he's trying to hide his interest in another QB? But then, maybe Belichick knows that the Bills would find his interest in Rudolph suspicious, which means maybe he really IS interested in Rudolph, and only wants the Bills to think he's not. So they can clearly not choose the wine in front of him. And that's not even taking into account whatever interest the Steelers, Jaguars or Chargers might have in him. The only safe play, if they're in fact interested in Rudolph, is to take him now, though I expect they'll have quite a bit of interest in Calvin Ridley and D.J. Moore as well. But QB trumps everything else, we've seen it a thousand times, and unless the Bills are certain they can trade for Foles (which they won't be by the time the draft rolls around), I think they almost have to pull the trigger. I don't know what kind of QB Rudolph's gonna be, but I think he's got a chance, and it has nothing to do with his arm talent (average) or his poise in the pocket or the gimmicky offense OSU ran or any of that stuff. If he makes it as an NFL QB, it's gonna be because of his smarts. He's basically been calling plays at the line for OSU for the past two years, he's Payton esque in his study habits, and I don't think he'll have any problem adjusting to a different offense. It would be best if he had a little time to do so, and in Buffalo I don't know that McCarron will afford him that time, so we'll see. The good thing is I also think he's mentally tough, so even if he struggles during his rookie season, he ought to be able to bounce back.",22,Buffalo,1,1.22,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs
Bengals,Mason Rudolph,QB,Oklahoma St.,Andy Dalton isn't getting any better. While his cap hit isn't too bad he wouldn't be a costly cut as he doesn't have much dead money left.

If Dalton's play picks up Rudolph probably won't lose much stock if they want to trade him down the road.,46,Cincinnati,2,2.14,12QNCT2421ANRq5Umhkvs5QXVcLT8Xy26fp8dSRSTzs4

Colts,Maurice Hurst,DT,Michigan,"For the first time in as long as I can remember, I think the Saints will trade down to recoup some of their lost picks. They don't do it often, only three times since Loomis has been around, and all of those more than a decade ago. But it just makes too much sense this year, I think a lot of the guys they're eyeballing will be there in the second, and they really need to add picks this year, since they've already used so many of them in trades and the like. And at least two of the three trades they've made were in the second round, so it's not out of the ordinary for it to come at this range (some teams will trade down freely in the later rounds, but not at the top). And it has to be said that one of the best drafts the Saints ever had, IMO, was in 2006, when they traded down twice. They walked out of that one with Reggie Bush, Roman Harper, Jahri Evans, Rob Ninkovich, Zach Strief and Marques Colston. Man, what a haul. Why not try and do that again? And since the Colts have so many picks to play around with (and even more so thanks to the second trade down I have them pulling off), I could definitely see them trading back up, especially with so many guys they're gonna be interested in still on the board. So they flip New Orleans one of their many second rounders and their third (a slight overpay from the Colts). It's really difficult to pin down where Hurst is gonna go. A lot of people see him plummeting like into the third round due to his heart thing, and I imagine maybe he's off a lot of teams boards But to those teams that still have him on their board, he's becoming better and better value as more picks go by. Before the combine I thought he was a top 15 lock, and I thought there was a decent chance he'd move up even higher than that as the Aaron Donald comparisons grew heavier and heavier. And he has been cleared by doctors, let's not forget that. He's not a ticking time bomb health wise.

He went into the combine with more at stake than most, then he nailed it. I always like to see guys rise to the occasion like that, kicking ass when everyone's watching, when it matters. Says a lot about character. He tested as more athletic than we thought he might be. He ran virtually just as fast as Fred Warner, Leighton Vander Esch, Dorian O'Daniel and other linebackers considered to be the 'fast guys', and faster than Tegray Scales and Darius Leonard. He doesn't look as fast as those guys on tape, but the league's littered with guys who look like they're not moving fast at all when you watch them, but they're making plays left and right. My hunch is Kiser's one of those guys. Right now the Titans have a pretty goddamn gaping hole at ILB, Woodyard's probably certain to start at one spot but the other's up for grabs, so an ILB makes sense.

Eagles,Michael Dickson,P,Texas,"Hahaha, that's right! A punter in the fourth round. Suck it if you don't like it. Or don't, whatever. I'm not pressuring you. I said earlier how the Eagles didn't have any needs, well that's not exactly true. Their punter Donnie Jones retired after the Super Bowl victory, and now they've got no one. Nada, bubkus. Or, that's not right, they've got some guy named Cameron Johnston, or maybe it's Johnston Cameron, it's hard to say. It doesn't matter anyway. Because Cameron Johnston Cameron is no Michael Dickson. I'm not sure there's ever been a Michael Dickson before, not as a punting prospect. You know all those shows you watch, Path to the Draft and First Draft and whatever the hell CBS calls theirs (give it up for Houston Nutt), how they're always going on about safest player in the draft, or the player most likely to be a star in ten years, and they always say Nelson or Barkley and a few of them say Chubb but mostly it's those guys... well my answer would be Michael Dickson. (Of course after I wrote this I noticed the post on the sub about this very thing, so kudos, u/TTrevor11, for stealing my damn Dickson thunder). I can't see any way he's not a twenty year fixture at the Pro Bowl. Move over Ray Guy, Michael Dickson's coming for your yellow jacket. And since Philly's roster is loaded they can roll the dice on a punter in the fourth round. Why not? Fix the position for twenty years, no one's gonna remember when he got drafted.",132,Philadelphia,4,4.32,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Cowboys,Michael Gallup,WR,Colorado State,"(Note written way back before Dez was released). Here's a fact about the Dallas roster in two years, Dez, Terrence Williams, and Cole Beasley won't be on it. OK maybe that's not a fact, but it's a widely held opinion, and if it turns out to be true that leaves, what, Allen Hurns and Ryan Switzer? Anyone else? That's pretty damn thin. Sure, they could wait and maybe add another guy next year, but receivers are notoriously slow to adapt to the NFL, recent years notwithstanding. Is that how we think the Cowboys are gonna treat Dak? I have my doubts. And what a steal to get a guy like Gallup this late, he's in the top five of my personal board, but like Washington, I understand some of the knocks against him. His effort when he's not involved with the play is a bad look. He gives little more than an offhanded shove when he's run blocking, and sometimes not even as much as that. His routes become lazy, he gets frustrated and his effort dips when he's not getting the ball or when he's being shut down. He also doesn't help his QB out much on throws that aren't perfect. But then I've probably just described 50% of the receivers in the league, and what Gallup does offer more than offsets the things he doesn't (I mean, at least enough to make him a third rounder). He's gonna make Dak's numbers look really good when he takes those slants and screens and turns them into long gains, he's one of the better receivers in the class once the ball's in his hands. He's also got that intuitive knack on the back shoulder fades, and he's another guy who, like Washington, would benefit from a metric that was able to discern 'play strength' and 'play speed'.

Ravens,Mike Gesicki,TE,Penn State,"I expect Ravens fans would be shitting themselves if they were able to come out of this draft with Courtland Sutton, Christian Kirk and Mike Gesicki. The only question here was whether to go Gesicki or Hurst. I actually like Hurst better as a prospect myself, but I imagine a lot of teams will have him lower on their boards due to his age. But he's a much better blocker than Gesicki and maybe that sways Ozzie, Gesicki blew up the combine the way very few TEs have before him, and the only reason he's lasted this long is because not too many tight ends have gone, and he's a terrible blocker. But being a bad blocker didn't stop Evan Engram from going in the first round, so maybe some team will value Gesicki higher than this, I just have a real problem with his blocking, it's a turn off, and I expect it'll be a turn off to a lot of NFL FOs too. But Ozzie's drafting Gesicki as a weapon for Flacco, and in that role, I'm not sure there's a better fit. And they'd be looking up at the Jets and Dolphins about to pick and thinking to themselves, we need to get in front of them. It costs the Ravens their late fourth, but I think they'll be fine with that if they can come out of the draft with these three guys.",71,Baltimore,3,3.7,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Both of their picks thus far have filled gaping holes, what more needs to be said? I guess I can explain the trade I have Green Bay trading Cleveland's own pick in the fourth round back to them to move up ten spots and nab a CB I imagine will be at the top of a lot of boards at this point. I like it, cause it lets me go 4101 Cleveland Browns (From Cleveland via Green Bay). How absurd. I'm kinda surprised to see Hughes fall into the second, to be honest, but that run I was expecting on DBs at the end of the first round never really materialized. Green Bay's the beneficiary, as they're able to move up and grab a guy who was being mocked to them in the first round back in February, and how much has changed, really?

I don't know. I just know it usually works. New England has enough picks to jump up in the draft and they gotta find a guy to replace Solder. For my money, McGlinchey's the only first round OT in the draft, the rest are all jumbled together and could go in any kind of order. The Pats don't want to mess with those guys, they want the best guy, and this is only one pick off where they found Solder back in 2011. There's some symmetry to it.

Rams,Minkah Fitzpatrick,S,Alabama,"I'm thinking this is a good way to piss off two fanbases. For the Redskins fans, I gather you'll want me to keep your boys here to draft Minkah yourselves, or James maybe, right? Well I thought about it, but that hole in the third round has to weigh pretty heavily, and I'm guessing there's a few guys your FO will like. Enough to accept the Chargers trade offer? I think probably so. The allure of getting back into the third round is too strong (and yes, I've heard that your FO loves Minkah, but I take everything I hear blared from beat writers right now with a big heaping spoonful of salt. Why would they announce it to the world?). For the Chargers fans, this is a lot to give up, right? Especially for a team with only seven picks. But we all know Telesco's not afraid to move up in the draft, we've seen him do it a few times (hell, he's made the Chargers' picks must see TV), and some team is gonna view Fitzpatrick as a special enough player to move for, especially if he starts to fall. He and James both make some sense here, but it's gonna be easy for an FO to fall in love with the things Minkah can do for them. No, he's not a traditional DB, he's one of the newfangled swiss army knife DBs, like the honey badger. Use him to exploit matchups, or to keep opposing offenses from exploiting matchups. Play him in the slot, or at safety or LB, or even outside sometimes, move him around, let him terrorize. Just don't stick him in one position and make him stay there, that's not his game. My hunch is anyone willing to draft him this high knows that. In fact I suspect they'll be enamored with him, and Saban's endorsement doesn't hurt. I think he can be a transformative player, and do for the Chargers defense what Polamalu did for the Steelers, Reed for the Ravens or Earl Thomas for the Seahawks. In fact Polamalu's the best comp for him I think, not so much in their physical traits but in the way Minkah should be used. Basically, all over the place. I think he's smart enough you could basically tell him ""just do the best thing"", and he would, over and over again. I think his fall is entirely unwarranted, but I think he's a lot like Lamar Jackson, in that 70% of the lily",13,Los Angeles,1,1.13,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Even though it’s not #1, the Raiders do have a need for a slot defender, and I think that’s what Fitzpatrick is, at the very least. He’s potentially a swiss army knife in coverage.

Roquan Smith is a popular selection here with good reason, but the one knock on him is that he struggles shedding blockers and his defensive line needs to keep him clean of blockers to let his speed do the work. The Raiders defensive line struggles, outside of Khalil Mack and Bruce Irvin (in spurts), to create pressure, so I think Roquan Smith could struggle here. Minkah Fitzpatrick could be that secondary playmaker they look for, and they could give him a year to figure out where he fits along the secondary.",10,Oakland,1,1.10,1J33HKGU4RxTQ1OSYppzlUEW3IXyuurLGxGc_TJgtJNU
49ers,Minkah Fitzpatrick,S,Alabama,"With Sherman and Witherspoon on the perimeter, Fitzpatrick is an elite slot corner/safety defensive back.

Bears,MJ Stewart,CB,UNC,"In the first mock I did back in February, I had Stewart going in the first round. That shows you what I think of him. But I'm trying to read the tea leaves here and lay the draft out as close as possible to how I think it's gonna go, and it's starting to look like Stewart's gonna come off the board in the 2nd or 3rd sometime, giving someone a steal. Regrettably, for this Lions fan, that someone is the Bears. The only thing going against Stewart is he's not a freak athlete. It didn't stop him from basically shutting down the entire ACC for three years, but he's not one of those guys who's gonna wow at the combine. Instead he's a tough as balls, sticky tactician. He rarely got beat whether in press or off coverage, he attacked when the ball was in the air, he's a sure tackler. He just understands angles and positioning and he rarely gets beat. He's a bit of a poor man's Carlton Davis actually, by which I mean a slightly smaller Carlton Davis so I probably should have just said that instead, since the 'poor man's' business is kinda insulting. Actually, he reminds me of Malcolm Butler, except he's faster. He's faster than Richard Sherman and Josh Norman and Joe Haden too and quite a bit faster than the guy we drafted in the second last year, Teez Tabor. So no, he's not a burner, but he's got the skills to stick around for a long time. And since Chicago's got Kyle Fuller and Prince Amukamara and a bunch of question marks at CB (including Marcus Cooper), they gotta come out of this thing with another one. He can also be flexed to safety in a pinch.",83,Chicago,3,3.19,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Lions,Natrell Jamerson,S,Wisconsin,"I'm sorry Lions fans, truly I am. It wasn't my intention to come out of this thing without a running back, but honestly, would you be shocked? Listen to what Quinn's saying. Listen to the way he talks up Abdullah. Listen to the way he blames (without blaming) Ron Prince, our former O Line coach. Listen to the way he talks about the line, and the scheme, and the symbiosis between all of them. He doesn't think our problem was our running backs, that's what I think. He thinks Blount, Abdullah, Riddick and Green are enough. Oh, I think he'd take one if one fell to a reasonable spot (Kerryon, Chubb or Freeman in this spot, for instance. Penny, Michel or Jones with one of our third rounders), but I don't think he'll throw too many resources at it. It's not what he's done so far, it's not what the Pats ever did. I think we're just gonna have to get used to it. Shit, I'd like to have a good running game, but I don't care if he rolls out Aveion Cason, as long as we win. As for the pick, yeah, it seems like another reach, at least right now. Honestly, I'm not trying to use the Lions picks just to promote my favorite sleepers, I would never do that. I don't really give af about Schultz, the TE from the third, I just think Quinn/Patricia will. I do love Adams, I can't lie, but he was also the highest rated guard left. Then there's this guy, Jamerson, who I'm torn on. But I do think there's a lot of interest in Jamerson. Every time I look at a team's visit list, he's on it. I don't know, maybe he's got some frequent flyer discount and he's paying his own way or something (a bad attempt at a joke. It's late, I'm tired, I've been hammering on this thing for a couple of weeks now, what do you want from me?). I imagine NFL teams are intrigued with his potential. He's new to the safety position, but he tested really well at the combine on top of winning defensive MVP at the East West Shrine game. He blazed his forty and looked great in the drills at the combine, he's only gonna get better and better. We met with him too, FWIW, and we're actually a great place for him to go.

Redskins,Nick Chubb,RB,Georgia,"With only one of the 'top tier' RBs remaining, my hunch is Washington will do whatever it takes to get ahead of Detroit so they can grab him, and that includes giving the Texans a 2019 pick, which will interest the Texans since they moved one of their own 2019 picks in an earlier trade with the Chiefs. The fact is this trade would cost the Redskins their 84th pick and a mid early sixth rounder, but they've only got a late sixth rounder and it's not enough. So you add a round for waiting a year and come up with a 2019 5th. I'm on record as not being Chubb's biggest fan, but I like him well enough and I know he tested well and if this was pre injury Chubb we were talking about, I'd be all over it.

Jaguars,Nyheim Hines,RB,North Carolina State,"I think a guy like Hines could prove to be the missing ingredient in an offense like the Jags. They've got some big play receivers, but everything out of the backfield is smashmouth and plodding (that's hyperbole, Jags fans, I know Fournette's not a plodder, what I mean is he's up the gut and in your face). Hines changes that. Suddenly you have to account for any toss sweeps they might run or fake. You have to account for him on screen passes and outlets into the flat, you have to account for him on handoffs when you're thinking pass, you have to keep him from getting the edge. I don't necessarily think the Jags offense is the most creative, but I don't think it has to be. Just putting Hines onto the field changes the way a defense will play you. Can you imagine spreading them out only for Fournette to keep going up the gut? It'll be unfair. He can be for the Jags what Bush and Sproles were for the Saints (and what Kamara is today), what Dion Lewis was for the Pats, what Corey Clement is for the Eagles. The explosive chess piece, the game changer, the variable. (Hmmm... I kinda like The Variable as a nickname).

It's safe to say the pre draft process didn't turn out like he would have liked. He flashed from time to time in the Senior Bowl, but he also got stonewalled plenty. At best I think you can call his performance 'uneven', and if you were so inclined, you could call it something worse than that. Well OK, the Senior Bowl's not the be all, end all, let's see how the athleticism he shows on tape tests. Oh. Not what we wanted exactly. And how ready is he really for the pros, given that janky college defense the Sooners run? Maybe we should take a step back on the guy.

Raiders,Orlando Brown,OT,Oklahoma,"Yeah, so I'm not really buying this multi round plummet that so many people keep espousing (though I wrote this so long ago now his stocks coming back up. I'm not changing it). Sure, he had a shit combine, but lots of guys have bad combines who go on to have stellar careers, the most important of whom, for our purposes, was his dad, Zeus. He of the long NFL career (that would have been longer had a ref not blinded him). You also have to put Brown's numbers into some context. Anyone expecting him to test well wasn't watching the same tape I watched. His main asset as a tackle is his freakish size, his play strength (more on that in a minute) and his good enough feet at that size to keep his QB clean (of all the tests at the combine he bombed, he actually had an average 3 cone drill). He's always been a bit of a successful lumberer, which made his evaluation difficult even before the combine. Now, there's also the narrative that says something along the lines of ""I don't care about his tape, his combine shows he's not willing to put in the work. This is a job, man."" To which I would counter so a guy who starts playing football in high school, shows up at OU at over 400 pounds then works his way down to 340 by his senior year isn't willing to work? That was the lightest he'd been since seventh grade. Of course he performed poorly on the bench, he's basically been on a diet for four years, he's got that bad weight loss body and man boobs, you all know what I'm talking about. Those kinds of bodies fill out as a person matures. Once he gets in an NFL strength program, he's gonna be as strong as anyone else in the league. If anything, I'm impressed with his work ethic.

Seahawks,Quenton Meeks,CB/S,Stanford,"Most teams aren't expecting to draft a guy in the fourth round who can come in and play right away. They may hope for it, but for the most part guys drafted around here take a year or two to acclimate to the league, which is why you see so many more WTF picks as BPA starts to supersede need. You're just not gonna fill a lot of needs this late. That's not necessarily true with Seattle and their CBs. They take great pride in identifying guys who are unique fits to their scheme and developing them so they can contribute early. Richard Sherman was famously a fifth round pick. Shaquill Griffin went at the end of the third, Byron Maxwell in the sixth. They found Brandon Browner in the CFL but he was an UDFA before that. You look at Meeks's scouting report and it reads like all of the stars from Seattle's past. Tall and a little slow, tough, smart (though at 31 3/4 inches, his arm length falls just short of the 32 inch marker Seattle traditionally used, but they bucked that tradition last year with Griffin, whose arms were exactly 31 3/4 inches long as well). The slow is what makes them fall, the tough, smart and tall is what makes them perfect for Seattle. And I'd argue Meeks is perhaps more prepared for the pros than all of the aforementioned guys. He grew up the son of a NFL defensive coach, his technique is subsequently excellent, and apparently he's a film and workout junkie. He's got everything you want in a CB except speed, and when I see guys like him, the first thing I think is 'Seattle'. (Though now that other teams are running Seattle's defense they've got some competition).",120,Seattle,4,4.20,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Bears,Quenton Nelson,OG,Notre Dame,"I toyed with having the Bears move down which I'm sure they'd very much like to do, but I just don't see Arizona or Buffalo jumping this high to snag Jackson, the last of the QBs, if they jump at all. Then I toyed with the idea of mocking Edmunds here, but in the end, I think in a division with Rodgers, Stafford and Cousins, Edmunds would have a tough adjustment to the league. I think he's gonna be the kind of guy who makes a lot of flash plays early in his career, but who also gets schooled by savvy QBs on play action fakes and the like. His athleticism's through the roof, but his football IQ still needs some work. Better, from Chicago's perspective, to get a more immediate contributor, and one who also happens to help keep QB baby clean. He's a different kind of weapon for QB baby, but he helps all the same. Plus they just hired his college OL coach, it feels like kismet.

Broncos,Rashaad Penny,RB,San Diego State,"If we go by his visit list then the running backs Elway has the most interest in are Barkley, Jones and Penny. Given Barkley and Jones are gone, Elway offers the Jags a fifth round pick to move up three spots and jump the Seahawks and Vikings (the latter more incidental than not) so he can grab the last of the backs he wants. Penny's a tricky guy to figure out. It's easy to love him if you just watch highlight reels of him knifing through defenses and in general, making them look silly. It's easy to love the ease with which he catches the ball and glides the length of the field. But it's when you watch the other plays, the ones where he's not as involved, that you begin to have some doubts. For one he's a bad blocker, I'm just coming out with it. People have tried to make excuses for him or suggest he wasn't told to stay in to block very often, I don't buy it. There's plenty of examples of him blocking, and he looks bad in almost all of them. To me, that's a red flag. So many RBs are coming into the league nowadays with at least some semblance of blocking know how. College teams are asking more and more of their backs, they're in the shotgun a lot, they generally have a good sense of where to be and when to get there. This class is especially impressive. Except Penny. And FOs aren't gonna want to see their QB get killed when a RB misses a block. When a rookie RB doesn't see the field, it's almost always cause he's struggling in that department. That said, with the ball in his hands he's electric. We saw it at the Senior Bowl. In fact the Senior Bowl might be a microcosm of his career. All week we heard about how he wasn't impressing, how he was struggling with schemes and his blocking was below par. Then the game started and he won MVP (alright, he didn't, but he could have). Maybe that's how his career will go. In the coach's doghouse, then he gets put in and lights it up. Stevan Ridley had the same sort of career. Let's hope Penny's ends up better than his. As a pure runner of the football, Barkley might be the only guy who's better.",61,Denver,2,2.29,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Steelers,Rashaan Evans,LB,Alabama,"Pittsburgh has to come out of this draft with an ILB, and preferably one who can start right away. I'm not sure I've ever seen a more gaping hole on a team that fancies itself a contender (not their fault, that hole, but still). I've heard a lot of Steelers fans say 'but we signed Bostic'. Alright, I hear you, but Bostic's been entirely average his whole career which is why the Steelers are his fifth team, despite him only being 26. Yes, he had a pretty good year last year, and maybe it's the start of a longer term improvement, but even if that's the case, Pittsburgh still needs another ILB. Williams and Matakevich should be backups only. I've also seen Steelers fans say they want to add one of those LB/S hybrids next to Bostic, which was kinda the role Shazier played. I'm not buying that either (or at least I think Burnett will cover that role on passing downs). Shazier's not a guy you can replace simply by grabbing a guy with similar measurements. He was a special cat, and his loss hurts. And the real bane of the Steelers D was their play against the run. Adding a hybrid guy next to Bostic won't help, they need a true ILB who can help out in the passing game, not the other way around. Stuff the run for two downs, bring a DB in for Bostic on passing downs, dominate. Given the way their season ended, and given there's actually some value at the position around here, my hunch is they'd really like to fill it. In that spirit, I imagine they've been trying to trade up for awhile. My Lions would have been receptive to trading down, but decided on the Pats deal as they wouldn't have to drop down as far. Of course they might have had the Steelers included their second round pick, but that would have been a rip off on the trade chart and I doubt the Steelers jump. I don't know, maybe they would have, but they haven't shown that in the past (the narrative is they don't really trade up, but that's not true, it's just been awhile), plus, while Roquan would plug nicely into their defense, he doesn't help them too much in the running game, and that's where Pittsburgh really needs help (see Jax games). Highly unlikely they'll overpay that much. Then the Bengals would have given them the Cincy salute, the Bills would be worried about the Pats or Jags jumping over them for Rudolph if they dropped to 28th, the Lions a second time would have been worried about the Titans grabbing Carter themselves, and the Panthers want to stay put and nab the draft faller. I expect the call to the Titans was made only as a cursory deal they had to expect they'd lost out on the last viable first",25,Pittsburg,1,1.25,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Lions,Rasheed Green,DE/DT,USC,"It's hard to say you can really know a guy's tendencies after only two drafts, but one thing Quinn has done in both of them is hammer a need position. Last year it was linebacker, two years ago the offensive line. I doubt if he intended to come back to the d line so quickly, but when a guy like Green falls into your lap (and given his physical gifts, yes, I believe this is falling), you adjust. Green is an fascinating guy. My hunch is if he'd stayed in school he might have played his way into a top fifteen pick next year. He's got everything you want in an athlete along the d line, he just needs some refinement (he's only 20). But that has the potential to make this a real value pick, and if there is one thing I feel confident saying about Quinn, it's that he's always looking for value (like his Patriot mentors). My guess is Green's fallen a little from where his talent says he should go due to fit. Is he a big end? A UT? A 5 tech? He's not really a perfect fit for any of those (he might grow into a fit, but he's not one right now). At USC he felt kinda wasted inside and did his best work when he flexed to the edge, but he's not an NFL",51,Detroit,2,2.19,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Rams,Ronald Jones II,RB,USC,"You'll have a chance to yell at me below, Chargers fans, but while I've got your attention, allow me to at least explain myself. It'll only take one word Telesco. Alright fine, that's simplifying, but you have to admit he does some zany stuff on draft day. One of the things he's most fond of is grabbing ""his guy,"" regardless of need, in the second round. He's even traded up a few times to do it. He keeps things pretty close to the vest so it's hard to say who his guy's gonna be, so I'm going with my gut a little bit here, (shit, this whole thing's an exercise in going with my gut, really). But it's the second and third round running backs that tend to get drafted by teams who don't have running back as their strongest need, and yet a GM or two falls in love with them anyway. Think Mixon to Cincy last year, or Kamara to the Saints, Foreman to the Texans, Connor to the Steelers. Prosise to the Seahawks the year before, Jeremy Hill to the Bengals, Charles Sims to the Bucs back before that. It's an epidemic. And while I'm sure you'll pick up Gordon's fifth year option before the season starts, that doesn't mean you'll actually sign him to it (see the Lions and Ebron), so the need exists, even if it falls behind an OT and a DT, for instance. And Jones is an easy guy to fall in love with. Kind of the forgotten guy amongst the early",48,Los Angeles,2,2.16,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

So they make a deal. I expect there will be league wide cries of discontent once this one goes down, (especially within the drafting community). The rich getting richer, how do they keep pulling things like this off, post draft grade A+++. But like I said earlier, I don't think Roquan will be nearly as high on the boards of NFL teams as he is on ours. It's just not a position that gets drafted very high. Of course, if there's one coach/GM who won't be concerned about drafting a one trick linebacker too high, it's Belichick. He's just not gonna give af.

Roquan is the top instinctual LB in this class, and his excellent athleticism allows him to be always be the first player to the ball on outside runs as well as big plays in the box.

Seahawks,Royce Freeman,RB,Oregon,"So I've already described how the macro version of 'draft misinterpretation' works, it's the one we all experience, the one that's controlled by the narrative. The most well known examples of this are Andrew Billings and Mike Mitchell, where the entire draft community was just so totally wrong about them, but it happens every year. Every time you say 'I can't believe so and so's falling this far', or 'man, what a reach' (for instance, perhaps right here, with this pick), that's us being influenced by the narrative. But there's a micro version of this narrative too, and it's far more interesting. It tends to develop where the draft discussion is more insulated, on team specific forums and message boards, outside of the influence of the rest of us heathens. There, a view might be espoused, and it might get seconded by someone else, until the whole community just sort of accepts that it's the way it is. As someone who's frequented lots of these forums over the past few days, I've seen my share of the micro love, but my favorite example of it is on one of the Seahawks boards, where everyone there is just certain Ronald Jones is going in the top 20 picks. When someone suggests they might be able to get him later, they tend to get shot down in a hail of dismissals and are rarely heard from again. Now, maybe they're right and we're all wrong, it wouldn't be totally shocking to see Jones go that early, but it's certainly a viewpoint not shared by the majority of us. And as it turned out, if they wanted to, they could have snagged him at 33. But with Suh in the division Hernandez was too tempting to pass up, so it's on to plan B at running back, Royce Freeman. I expect this one will get a few ooohs and aaaahs from the crowd and a few WTFs from both the draft forums at large and specifically Seahawks fans (though there's bound to be a few more Ducks fans among them). I do think the Seahawks would have preferred a back like Jones or Michel or Penny as they would have better complimented Chris Carson and Mike Davis, but that's not the way the draft fell and the Seahawks really don't have the capital to move up. And I think they really do need",63,Seattle,2,2.31,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Titans,Sam Hubbard,DE/OLB,Ohio State,"I know, Titans fans, I know. I did you a solid with the trade down, but now this? I mean, I'm sure some of you like it but I'm guessing most of you would have preferred Justin Reid or Ronnie Harrison, and I thought about that, I really did, but I find myself leaning Hubbard for a number of reasons. First of all, this is a deep class at safety. I doubt Reid will be there by your second round pick, but it wouldn't shock me if Harrison got close (and Bates too, though he's the wrong kind of safety). So I think you can kick that one down the road a bit. Also, you guys have a pretty obvious need at edge, and edge>safety, every day. It's not dire, necessarily, but Orakpo and Morgan are both getting up there in age, and both of their contracts run out after this year. Even if Dodd improves there's still a hole on one side and Hubbard would fill it nicely. I also think the Pats are gonna be interested in Hubbard, and generally, when I think the Pats are gonna be interested, I think the Titans (and Lions, tbf) are gonna be interested too. They value a lot of the same things in guys, that's just how it is. But mostly I think Hubbard is gonna be one of Vrabel's favorites.

Trey Flowers had a solid season and James Harrison was a decent patch, but depth as a whole was lacking. Derek Rivers will be back, but the Patriots could stand to add a consistent force in Sam Hubbard. Hubbard, to me, is more of a disruptor than a finisher, but that's not exactly a bad thing. He has excellent athleticism, and he's able create pressure in the backfield on a consistent basis. He's still raw and has some room to grow into his frame, but his ability to collapse the pocket would help out big time.",43,New England,2,2.11,1tjRGL5x00edczECWbeNCH6qeZeDSG886Lxls8-yUq8g

However, I try to stay away from predicting too many trades in my mock drafts. If they remain put here, they could take BPA or reach on a need. This is a weak draft for DE’s, but Hubbard had a very strong finish to his season (2.5 sacks vs both Michigan AND USC).

In Fournette's case, you had a team run by Tom Coughlin wanting to turn the team into a Tom Coughlin team, a bruising RB, a defense that should be great based on the draft and FA in 2017, and a QB who needed the ball taken out of his hands as much as possible.

Dolphins,Shaquem Griffin,LB,Central Florida,"Man, I hope Griffin hasn't been sitting around in the green room since the draft started, this is a long damn time to wait. But I also think it's roughly the sweet spot for him. If he wasn't missing a hand, I think he'd go anywhere from the late first to the mid second. Conversely, if he hadn't performed so well at the Senior Bowl and combine, I think he'd be looking at making a team as a 7th/UDFA. This feels like a good compromise. And don't think the story of Griffin doesn't play a large role, he's a PR dream, the marketer's job is gonna be cake. That said, you don't draft a guy because he's gonna help your image, or to be the top story on NFL Network. He has to be worth drafting, and Shaquem Griffin is worth drafting. In fact he might *still be underrated. The fact is the Dolphins could desperately use a linebacker who can do the things Griffin can do. He can cover (former DB), he can get after the passer, he can straight fly. I expect the missing hand to prevent him from making maybe 5 10 plays a season, while I expect his talent, heart, instincts and will to account for an extra fifty plays made. My math's not what it used to be (or ever was, tbh), but that seems like a net gain of forty",123,Miami,4,4.23,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs
Steelers,Shaquem Griffin,LB,Central Florida,I had the Steelers go offense with their first two picks and now they need to address the defense.

Bears,Sony Michel,RB,Georgia,"I know this might seem nuts to you guys right now, Bears fans, but I really don't think Howard's long for your team. He might have even been traded by draft day, maybe to the Colts for a third or fourth round pick (the draft's too deep at RB to get much else), or as part of a first round trade up (obviously I'm not banking on that one, as I didn't have it happening). Even if he's still on your roster by the time the draft rolls around, I think you guys start planning for a future without him. A RB who's bad in the passing game just doesn't fit Nagy's offense. And if Howard's not in your plans, what else to you have? Cohen? I think we can all agree he's great, but he's not an every down back. And don't forget this is the summer of Mitch. It's almost a cliche' by this point, but it's also a smart move to give your franchise QB everything it takes to succeed. That's why if I hadn't gone RB here, I was looking WR. But the depth at WR is great, and now that the trade down with Baltimore has got you back into the third round, you can address it later. And I don't want to downplay how perfect a fit I think Michel would be for Nagy's offense. He's like a combo of Kamara and Hunt, and we already know one of those guys fits like a glove. When he makes it to this spot, I think Pace pulls the trigger. And the more you think about it, the more it makes sense, right? This is the kind of draft day stuff that always happens. The teams that take RBs in the second/third aren't usually the ones with the glaring, obvious need. It tends to be a secondary need, and then when they shred the league and end up in ROY conversations, you can't imagine why you didn't like the pick at the time (see Kamara, Hunt). It also helps that there's no edge talent worth taking here, which I agree is a dire need (and it looks like Pace knows it too, which is why you're bringing in so many mid round edge guys). You could make the argument Sweat or Key might go this high, but they've got some red flags that are gonna scare teams (Sweat injury history; Key duh). So why not throw a bone to your new coach, your QB, and by November or so, your fanbase?",52,Chicago,2,2.20,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Titans,Taron Johnson,CB,Weber State,"At this point I think we can essentially scrap the narrative. By the fourth round, picks are coming hot and heavy and as often as not, it's full of guys we thought were later round picks (Howard Wilson, Michael Roberts, Grover Stewart, De'Vondre Campbell), guys we thought wouldn't even be drafted (Antonio Morrison, Alex Lewis, Derrick Kindred, Dean Lowry) or even a few guys we've never heard of (Rodney Gunter?... who looks like a hell of a pick). In fact this whole round is probably too chalk if I'm honest, though I doubt you guys will see it that way. No, CB isn't Tennessee's direst need, but neither was WR when they took Taylor in the third last year. Neither was DT when they took Austin Johnson in the 2nd a year prior. And neither is Johnson, here, though the depth after Butler, Ryan and Jackson leaves something to be desired. If one of those guys gets hurt, they'll be glad they have Johnson as a safety valve. I think Robinson's gonna like Johnson cause he's not so wowed by guys with flashy combine numbers, but by guys who produced. And Johnson produced.

Steelers,Tarvarius Moore,S,Southern Mississippi,"Here's what's tough to figure out about the Steelers what kind of safety do they want to add? If they're looking at covering for their first team, a free safety makes the most sense, as Davis is far more questionable as a starter than Burnett. We have no idea how he'll perform switching to FS (you have to think the Steelers would have some idea, but then why didn't they shift him there last year, when Mitchell proved that he sucked?). On the flip side, if they're looking for a more long term solution, a SS makes more sense, as Davis is only 24 while Burnett is 29. One of those guys will need replacing before the other. However, if they're looking for fit in a nickel, 3 safety look (something they used a lot with Shazier), maybe they think Burnett would flex into the hybrid role and Davis into the strong role he played last year, in which case a FS would make more sense. Unless they think Davis should stay at free safety during a 3 safety look, in which case they'd be looking for more of a SS, and if they also kept Burnett at SS when they went nickel, then they'd be looking for more of a hybrid guy, possibly even a LB. Whew. And of course they've given nothing away with their visits as they've brought in all three types, from free safeties like Bates to strong safeties like Harrison to hybrid linebackers like Baker and O'Daniel. So, what the hell are we supposed to think? My hunch? BPA among those guys. Harrison and Bates are gone so their out of the picture, which would appear to leave Baker (though he's got some issues, especially in coverage). But then there's this late",60,Pittsburg,2,2.28,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Raiders,Taven Bryan,DT,Florida,"Taven Bryan the next J.J. Watt? No. Taven Bryan the next Howie Long. I mean, not exactly, but tell me that didn't give you a little stir, Raiders fans. Tell me you didn't make you feel all warm inside. My uncle's a Raiders fans, I know how you guys get. Every Time someone brings up Howie Long around him he always, always says ""Howie Long was a ball player"". That's all, just that. I need to record him and make a sound drop out of it. So if the draft plays out like this, I'm thinking the Jags take a look around at all the offensive linemen and tight ends who haven't been taken up to this point and think to themselves shiiiit, we can still grab one of our guys further down. Plus, we all know the end of the first's a hot spot for trade action, it happens all the time. You got the fifth year option, you got the pending overnight wait, you got droppers getting back in range. It's a cornucopia of trade circumstance. Now I will admit, I wanted this one to happen so bad I basically forced the trade chart to bend to my will and I might have jacked it up in the process. It's always dicey including future picks and I prefer not to do it, but hey, it's a thing that happens. And the Jags are the type of loaded team that's always adding future picks, that's how you stay on top. So I made it work, in the end (and it's a little more palatable from the Raiders perspective given they added another second rounder via the earlier trade down with Arizona). I don't know how happy you Raiders fans are gonna be with this trade, it's a lot to give up and McKenzie's typically a guy who likes to trade down rather than up. But there's a new sheriff in town as they say, and the draft's his coming out party. It's time to start putting his imprint on the team. And tell me Bryan doesn't seem like a player Gruden's gonna love. You won't, cause you can't. And man do the Raiders need someone just like him, yet another reason I have them trading up. After Bryan's off the board, you're on to your Nathan Shepherds and Da'Shawn Hands and Harrison Phillipses.

Rams,Tegray Scales,LB,Indiana,"The Rams are going for it, we all know that, but they've got a couple of pretty gaping holes in their lineup that may or may not be able to be filled by draft picks, but they don't have a lot of other options. Some inexpensive guys are gonna have to perform. Pass rusher is one of them, and they'll hope they've sorted that one out at least partly with the selection of Turay. Another is ILB after shipping Ogletree off, and while I don't know if Scales is the answer or not, I know he'll have plenty of room to run around and make plays behind Suh and Donald. Scales isn't the greatest athlete at ILB, but he's one of the draft's smartest and most instinctive. After years of Ogletree and his missteps, smart and instinctive is gonna seem pretty good. Pair him with another fast linebacker (Barron?), and Scales will clean up in the middle of the Rams D. His reaction time and trust in what he sees makes him play faster than he times. I think he's perfect for the Rams, and I think teams that try to wait on him are gonna be surprised by how high he goes. He's also the source of one of my favorite forum one liners Jorah Mormont has Tegray Scales. I wish I could remember where I saw it so I could give the author credit, but alas, I've looked at a lot of posts over the last couple of weeks and they're all starting to run together.

Seahawks,Terrell Edmunds,S,Virginia Tech,"The Seahawks could damn near go anywhere with this pick they got so many needs which is crazy to me, just crazy. It feels like ten years since I've come into a season and the Seahawks haven't been loaded, but here we are. That's how it goes when you don't have a QB on a rookie contract anymore, you gotta trim the fat and a lotta the meat. But let's not act like they couldn't use a safety anyway, who knows how much longer Earl's around for, and Kam's got those injuries, man, they're piling up. Sure they drafted a couple of guys last year, Delano Kash Pride Hill (winner, multiple name contests) and Tedric Thompson, they tried to look out for this day, but Thompson might get his shot at corner, not safety. And even if they both get their shot, there's two holes that need filling, and in the NFL that generally means it takes at least three guys to fill it (one to fail, two to work out). Edmunds has the good blood lines of his dad and brothers, football's gonna be important to him, he was a leader on that Hokie defense. He does his best work at the line but he's no slouch in coverage either. Great athlete, the fact that he started his career as a corner still shows in his game. He can be over aggressive at times and whiff on a tackle or two which can make him look silly, he's gonna have to learn to break down and lay a form hit on a guy, but I'd rather that than the opposite.",108,Seattle,4,4.8,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Browns,Tim Settle,DT,Virginia Tech,"I expect this to irk a few Browns fans, who would have rather I give them one of the offensive tackles available. While I'm sure you'll add one at some point in the draft, everything I read says Shon Coleman's gonna get first crack at it, it's what he played in college, and he's already working with Joe Thomas on learning the position. That gets Chris Hubbard on the field (who I'm a huge fan of), and that to me doesn't look like a position that needs to be addressed in the second round. Sure it could be if the need met the value, but the value here is with Settle. He's a guy someone's gonna take high, he's got rarely seen gifts for a guy his size. The key's gonna be whether he can keep his weight down or not, but if he does he's got all pro potential. He's a giant, dancing bear, and he'll fit snugly right into the middle of Cleveland's line next to Ogunjobi on first and second down, then on passing downs they can bring out the death lineup of Chubb, Ogbah, Garrett and Ojunjobi. Eventually maybe Settle stays in too, he's got enough giddy up even on his huge frame. But after trading away Danny Shelton, they've got an opening for a mammoth in the middle.",45,Cleveland,2,2.13,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Lions,Tony Adams,G,NC State,"How is it North Carolina State wasn't playing in the national championship game? It's bizarre how many high level draft picks they have in this class. You expect that sort of thing out of an Alabama, or an Ohio State, but N.C. State? Before Kentavius Street's injury all four of their starting defensive linemen were in line to be drafted (Chubb, B.J. Hill, Justin Jones, Street), then there's Nyheim Hines, Jaylen Samuels, Will Richardson and this guy, Tony Adams. That's a lot of NFL talent on one team, though I wonder if they're gonna suck next year. Anyway, tangent aside, at least it's the right position this time, right Lions fans? I know it seems a little high based on what we know right now, but I'm pretty certain NFL FOs are gonna love Adams. On top of that, we know Quinn's not afraid to reach if he likes a guy. Tabor, Golladay, Glasgow, they were all drafted before we thought they'd be, and two out of three of those have worked out (and the jury's still out on Tabor). Adams is a three year starter with a wrestling and tennis background, he's squatty and quick and athletic, great at pulling, good with his hands and almost never gets penalized.

Worst case he's an elite special teams guy, best case he works himself into Jacksonville's nickel role ahead of DJ Hayden or Jaylen Myrick. He's not a pick that's gonna excite anyone, we all watched him get surpassed on the depth chart at Bama by Levi Wallace despite his athleticism, but maybe he's just a late bloomer. Or maybe he takes a little longer to learn things. That's what FOs will be thinking when they draft him, and maybe they'll be right. Cause if you can turn the piece of clay that is Tony Brown into a player, you might have a pro bowler on your hands. And don't be surprised if the Jags get some weight on him and try him out as a hybrid linebacker. He's tough enough for it, and run defense is his strength. On top of all that, doesn't he just seem like a Jag? Crazy Tony back there barking with Jalen and the rest of 'em?

All of a sudden it's everywhere like it was crafted to be tweeted and retweeted until it's a dead solid certainty that the Colts are taking Roquan Smith. Well I for one don't believe it. Now I do believe they like him, sure, but everyone likes him. I doubt you could find a team one that wouldn't want him as part of their squad. But enough to draft him this high, ahead of so many other good players? That's where I have the problem. He's still a small(ish) chase linebacker who has to be covered up, and no matter how good his tape is (and I agree with everyone that it's great), those guys don't get taken high, they just don't. If Ballard does pull the trigger, he'll be bucking decades of history to do it. I also expect the Colts really do want to get faster at LB, that makes perfect sense. But there's another guy a guy with a much higher ceiling, a guy you wouldn't have to cover up who's pretty damn fast himself.

Edmunds has the ideal size and athlteicism combo to become a force in this league, and he commands space in the box and also in coverage. The biggest thing holding Edmunds back is instinctual lapses, but at only 19 years old he is still learning the game and the sky is the limit. San Fran has done a great job developing talented linebackers and Edmunds could be the next in line.",9,San Francisco,1,1.9,1c58OHbhjV-75cVMmTywz3xRzepq32eus0ihZ1f-d3Fs

ability to show spurts of greatness but also lapses of concentration and

I still think he likely outperforms this draft spot in the long run, but it could take a few years before LAC sees his true ability.

Bears,Tremaine Edmunds,LB,VT,"The Bears have done well in free agency to address their most glaring needs at wide receiver and cornerback. I think the Bears would do well to address wide receiver later in the draft to add some depth, but they eliminated the need in the first round. Retaining Kyle Fuller was huge as well, as it allows them to be flexible with this pick. Should they not be enamored with Edmunds or Smith, I could see them trading back with Buffalo or Arizona, and I do think this does eventually happen if Josh Allen is still on the board. However, I have the Bears selecting Tremaine Edmunds over Roquan Smith solely due to Edmunds' youth and sky-high potential.

I considered cornerback but with the 3 year contract given to Amukamara and 4 years to Fuller, the perimeter guys are locked up. As of this writing slot man Bryce Callahan is still on the roster and he is solid.

I watched a couple of games of his and you know how there's those guys that just look like they're gonna be pros? He's got that look. A playmaker. Good returner too. You can work with that stuff, and yeah, he needs work. He's coming from Central Arkansas of course he needs work. Other UCA alums Scottie Pippen, Charlie Strong, the guy who owns 4chan. They needed work too, probably. That's a big step up out and into the world. On Atlanta, he's probably the 3rd CB? There's Trufant and Alford and then... Bleedy Ray? Burnt Bethel?

Buccaneers,Tyquan Lewis,DE,Ohio State,"Still peeved at me over the Barkley trade, Bucs fans? I know it's been awhile since we've seen you, took the whole of Friday off, but don't you worry about a dull draft, you're about to have an exciting season. And OK sure you just added Pierre Paul and Vinny Curry via FA, but both of those guys will be thirty by the time the season ends, Noah Spence can't stay healthy, and William Gholston is an expensive run defender who can't get to the QB. That's not the way you keep winning. Lewis got on my radar at the Senior Bowl. I thought he was better than Davenport during the practices. Then he went to the combine and crushed it. I don't know if the Bucs are a Sparq team, but my hunch is every team is a little Sparqy, everyone uses metrics, and they could all use the kind of player with the Sparq score Lewis put up. He was the third highest scorer behind only Lorenzo Carter and Josh Sweat, and ahead of guys like Harold Landry and Ogbonnio Okoronkwo. And he's got almost twenty pounds on 'em! So much for the average athleticism he was alleged to have. So, back to the tape, why wasn't he a Buckeye legend? Well I've already been over how Ohio State likes to rotate and shift guys around. It's not easy to put up huge numbers in their system, they're just too loaded and varied. Still, he was honorable mention all Big",102,Tampa Bay,4,4.2,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Bills,Tyrell Crosby,OG/OT,Oregon,"I usually like to try and avoid trades between teams from the same division, but an in depth skimming of the past five drafts shows there's been exactly one every year. So this is my one. The Pats and Bills strike me as professional enough organizations to see past any bitterness that might exist from their years as rivals, they'll do what's best for their teams. And the best thing for New England is to add picks. The best thing for Buffalo is to draft this future star. I think Crosby's got a chance to be one of the best players to come out of this draft, and I think the Bills are lucky to find him still on the board here. In the mock I did back in February I had him as a (pretty high) first rounder. On most early iterations of this I've had him at the tail end of the first or the upper end of the second. But shit keeps happening in the league, and this is the end result Crosby for a bargain. I think his versatility will fit perfectly on the Bills line, who all of a sudden have a plethora of holes. I think Crosby's a starting tackle in the league (his light feet at the Senior Bowl took everyone by surprise), but I think he could be an all pro at guard or center. So start him off at guard, if Bodine doesn't work out, move him over. If Newhouse doesn't work out, move him over. Either way, you've solved a lot of problems with one guy.",43,Buffalo,2,2.11,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Lane Johnson has solidified himself as one of the very best RTs in the league and I'd be surprised if Philly tries to move him, so they need a future player to takeover once Peters is gone. Tyrell Crosby anchored Oregon's OL and is a developed pass-blocker. His technique is fairly wonky, but he operates from a strong base and uses his hands well. He's also great as a run-blocker, making him a capable early starter if needed.",32,Philadelphia,1,1.32,1c58OHbhjV-75cVMmTywz3xRzepq32eus0ihZ1f-d3Fs
Bears,Tyrell Crosby,OG/OT, Oregon,"After moving on from Josh Sitton, the Bears are looking to fill in the LG spot. Matt Nagy is bringing a zone blocking scheme to Chicago, and he’s hired former Oregon head coach, Mark Helfrich, as offensive coordinator. Crosby played his college games in a ZBS and has proven to be reliable in that scheme. He even played a couple of seasons under Helfrich. He played left tackle in college but projects better as a guard or RT in the NFL. The ideal outlook for him with this pick would be to start at guard, but eventually move outside to replace Bobby Massie at RT.",33,Chicago,2,2.1,1E0sLuvd0zyYycYXVijboxpJdRCDk2oFY

Chiefs,Uchenna Nwosu,DE/OLB,USC,"I could easily see some team falling in love with Nwosu and drafting him before this. In fact I think he'll be in play for my Lions at 51 if some other guys don't drop, the way I had it go here. He's got that look of someone who's gonna be a player in the league for 15 years. I thought he looked the best of any edge player during the combine drills. He was smooth, he didn't waste a lot of motion, his punches were violent. I think he could even play some inside linebacker given his size, speed (4.65) and fluidity. It would take some time for him to adjust, obviously, but I don't think it's a reach. NFL FOs are starting to draft these kinds of versatile defenders earlier and earlier, and whether Nwosu can be a viable option inside or not, he's got everything you want on the outside. He's athletic and mean, he looks to hit ball carriers as hard as he can, he looks good when he drops into coverage. He's new ish to the game and still learning, and he'll have to do some work in an NFL strength and conditioning program so he can hold the edge against the run, but the efforts there, and he's gonna do nothing but get better.",78,Kansas City,3,3.14,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Broncos,Vita Vea,DT,Washington,"I'm sticking with my take from my first mock, despite its heat and despite the fact Denver fans aren’t gonna like it. Vea is one of my favorite players in the draft, I think he would have set the combine on fire had he not pulled his hammy (and the one drill he did finish, he ran a great time for a man his size and his ten yard split was fantastic). Denver's done a decent job in FA of filling some of its holes, and I'll be honest, I just think the positional value of DT over OG (and Nelson) holds up here. I have the draft as deeper at guard than DT (not by a lot, admittedly) and honestly, I think Vea is every bit the prospect Nelson is (and I love Nelson too). All things being equal, I say Denver opts to throw this man mountain into the middle of their line to suck up double and triple teams and get to the QB now and again. Basically, I think he's a better player than prime Ngata, and we know what he meant to those Ravens defenses.

Seahawks,Will Hernandez,OG,UTEP,"I actually think the Seahawks O line, despite what everyone seems to think, is the least of their concerns. Or not the least, probably, that'd be QB, but I think I certainly wouldn't put it anywhere near the top of the list. They've done a good job of cobbling together a respectable unit, and I know in Seahawks country anyway, a lot of them think the problem was Cable. But the unit is paper thin, and virtually every one of them has spent time in and out of the lineup, and it would be shortsighted if Seattle didn't have a plan in case of injury given what's happened the past couple of years. It's not fair to Wilson, hell, it's not fair to the rest of their team, let alone the fans. On top of that, Suh + Donald. But I think they know that. They've spent the offseason espousing the need to upgrade their running game, their actions have backed it up, and I think it keeps going during the draft. It's time to turn a weakness into a strength. Also, and I can't stress this enough, Suh + Donald. A guy like Hernandez should be just what the doctor ordered to help keep Russ upright in the face of the Rams heat, though I would expect a few holding calls now and again, Hawks fans. But the best way to stop strong, brawny, nasty athletic guys is with your own, and Hernandez is just too nasty a guy and too perfect a fit here to slide any further (and if he beats out Fluker, all the better).",34,Seattle,2,2.2,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Jaguars,Will Richardson,OT,North Carolina State,"Normally, I like to get some idea what an FO is thinking by reading their visit list. I just feel like it's the best indicator of their true intentions, especially now, during the subterfuge season, when their words are all lies, lies, lies. That's not to say the visit list is infallible, of course. Some teams use visits more than others, and I'm sure some teams use it to send false messages as well (seems like a Belichick thing to do). But on the whole I think it's the best way to discover a team's intent at this time of year. Well, getting a read on what the Jags might do by reading their visit list seems like it might be an exercise in futility. One look at their boards and it's TE, OG, WR, over and over again, with some OT and QB sprinkled in. Well they've only met with two TEs, one interior lineman, and three wide receivers, two of them later round guys. Meanwhile they've met with five linebackers, three offensive tackles, four safeties, and only one QB, Baker Mayfield, who will not be available for them to pick. And a lot of their visits are with late rounders/UDFA types. So what gives? Are they trolling us? Maybe they only use the visits for their late round and UDFA moves, I can't figure it out. Last year they met with Fournette and Cam Robinson for sure (their first two picks), but there was no mention of meetings with any of the other guys they ended up drafting, though they did meet with other guys who played the positions of the other guys they drafted (For the record 3 DEs, drafted Smoot; 9 LBs, drafted Brown; 4 WRs, drafted Westbrook). Help me out if I'm wrong here, Jags fans, am I way off on this? Did you meet with some of the other guys you drafted and I just missed it? The reason I mention all of this is cause I had some beef with the way the Jags fans are thinking, so I decided to do a deep dive. And I wasn't alone, BTW. Sprinkled into all those posts on TE, OG, WR were a few lonely Jags fans who wondered, the way I do, why the Jags would take a TE so high? Maybe they do want to go to a two TE set, fine. But they brought in two guys in the offseason (Seferian Jenkins and Niles Paul), and while those aren't the guys who stop you from taking a TE, don't they kinda stop you from taking a strictly pass",64,Jacksonville,2,2.32,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs

Jets,Wyatt Teller,OL,Virginia Tech,"Gettleman said his first order of business was to fix the offensive line, he started the process in the first round and he continues it here. And the interior of the line is one place you can hope to find a starter in the fourth round, especially with a guy like Teller. I mentioned my beef with overrating ""mean streak"" players up at pick 122, in my explanation for the Chiefs nabbing Alex Cappa (you should read it, it's a tour de force), and Teller certainly falls into that category. He's more nasty and driven than athletic and technically sound and for whatever reason, he regressed in 2017. If you look at his 2016 tape, you'll see a guy who moves defensive linemen with his hands and makes it looks easy. You'll see a guy who's balanced and strong, a guy who drove defenders back in the run game, and who easily kept defenders away from his QB. You see glimpses of it in 2017, but far less frequently. He went from nasty to lazy, driven to uncaring. He lacked as a puller, he didn't seek out contact. Frankly, it was bizarre. But he rehabbed his stock some at the Senior Bowl, and if he can recapture his form from 2016, he could be a steal at this point.",133,New York,4,4.33,10f-mhamCqfZ0zpLPfNkq52GALUCUCW8LfYqZ1hGBYBs
Jets,Wyatt Teller,OL,Virginia Tech,"The Giants need OL help, it's no secret. and grabbing Teller at the top of 3 helps them protect their new investment at QB, and even work to improve their run game.",66,New York,3,3.2,14w9cCfU2F_gnzOTkGA3u4LBUTlgqqA-SON6y2557rqA
Vikings,Wyatt Teller,OL,Virginia Tech,"Vikings need to recover their Line back to where it was this year, and Teller can absolutely step in and Start Day 1 which is what they need.
